I. Executive Summary
In late May 2002, the management of Bell Labs formed a committee to
investigate “the possibility of scientific misconduct, the validity of the data and
whether or not proper scientific methodology was used in papers by Hendrik
Schön, et al., that are being challenged in the scientific community”. The
members of the Committee were M.R. Beasley (Chair), S. Datta, H. Kogelnik, H.
Kroemer and D. Monroe.
The first task of the Committee was to establish the specific allegations. This task
was complicated by the public nature of some of the allegations and by additional
allegations that came to the attention of the Committee as the investigation
progressed. By the time this initial process was ended on June 20, 2002,
allegations had been made about 25 papers, involving 20 coauthors. Of these
allegations, the Committee selected 24 Final Allegations for detailed examination.
 These Final Allegations can be grouped into 3 classes:
• Substitution of data (substitution of whole figures, single curves and
partial curves in different or the same paper to represent different
materials, devices or conditions)
• Unrealistic precision of data (precision beyond that expected in a real
experiment or requiring unreasonable statistical probability)
• Results that contradict known physics (behavior inconsistent with stated
device parameters and prevailing physical understanding, so as to suggest
possible misrepresentation of data)
In examining the allegations, the Committee sent questionnaires to all coauthors
and interviewed Hendrik Schön and his three principal coauthors (Zhenan Bao,
Bertram Batlogg and Christian Kloc). The Committee also examined drafts of
many of the papers in question, which were available in electronic form, including
the embedded, processed data files used to plot the figures. These data files
permitted detailed, quantitative examination of the data in the figures. The
Committee requested primary (raw) data files for some of the papers but was
unable to examine them because they no longer exist, as discussed below.
The Committee’s main findings and conclusions can be summarized as follows.
By all accounts, Hendrik Schön is a hard working and productive scientist. If
valid, the work he and his coauthors report would represent a remarkable number
of major breakthroughs in condensed-matter physics and solid-state devices.
 2 
Except for the provision of starting materials by others, all device fabrication,
physical measurement and data processing in the work in question were carried
out (with minor exceptions) by Hendrik Schön alone, with no participation by any
coauthor or other colleague. None of the most significant physical results was
witnessed by any coauthor or other colleague.
Proper laboratory records were not systematically maintained by Hendrik Schön
in the course of the work in question. In addition, virtually all primary (raw)
electronic data files were deleted by Hendrik Schön, reportedly because the old
computer available to him lacked sufficient memory. No working devices with
which one might confirm claimed results are presently available, having been
damaged in measurement, damaged in transit or simply discarded. Finally, key
processing equipment no longer produces the unparalleled results that enabled
many of the key experiments. Hence, it is not possible to confirm or refute
directly the validity of the claims in the work in question.
The most serious allegations regarding the work in question relate to possible
manipulation and misrepresentation of data. These allegations speak directly to
the question of scientific misconduct. The Committee carefully investigated each
of these allegations and came to a specific conclusion in each case.
The evidence that manipulation and misrepresentation of data occurred is
compelling. In its mildest form, whole data sets were substituted to represent
different materials or devices. Hendrik Schön acknowledges that the data are
incorrect in many of these instances. He states that these substitutions could have
occurred by honest mistake. The recurrent nature of such mistakes suggests a
deeper problem. At a minimum, Hendrik Schön showed reckless disregard for the
sanctity of data in the value system of science. His failure to retain primary data
files compounds the problem.
More troublesome are the substitutions of single curves or even parts of single
curves, in multiple figures representing different materials or devices, and the use
of mathematical functions to represent real data. Hendrik Schön acknowledges
these practices in many instances, but states that they were done to achieve a more
convincing representation of behavior that was nonetheless observed. Such
practices are completely unacceptable and represent scientific misconduct.
One of the most troublesome cases is that of superconductivity in polythiophene.
Here, identical curves appear multiple times in whole or in part in a single figure.
Hendrik Schön acknowledges that these data are not valid but cannot explain how
they arose. In the view of the Committee, it is not possible that this set of curves
represent real data and therefore this is a clear, unambiguous case of scientific
misconduct.
In the end, the Committee concluded that, of the 24 Final Allegations examined,
Hendrik Schön committed scientific misconduct in 16, some of which were
 3 
interrelated. Of the remaining 8, 2 were judged to have no clear relationship to
publications, while 6 were troubling but did not provide compelling evidence of
scientific misconduct.
The Committee finds all coauthors of Hendrik Schön in the work in question
completely cleared of scientific misconduct. The Committee also finds no
evidence that the laboratory practices of any coauthor of Hendrik Schön in the
work in question are outside the accepted practices of their fields.
In addition to addressing the question of scientific misconduct, the Committee
also addressed the question whether the coauthors of Hendrik Schön exercised
appropriate professional responsibility in ensuring the validity of data and
physical claims in the papers in question. By virtue of their coauthorship, they
implicitly endorse the validity of the work. There is no implication here of
scientific misconduct; the issue is one of professional responsibility.
The Committee found this to be an extremely difficult issue, which the scientific
community has not considered carefully. Therefore, no clear, widely accepted
standards of behavior exist. In order to proceed, the Committee adopted, for
working purposes, a minimal set of principles that it feels should be honored in
collaborative research. At its core, the question of professional responsibility
involves the balance between the trust necessary in any collaborative research and
the responsibility all researchers bear for the veracity of the results with which
they are associated. The Committee does not endorse the view that each coauthor
is responsible for the entirety of a collaborative endeavor: the relative
responsibility of researchers with very different expertise, seniority and levels of
participation must be considered.
The Committee examined this question for each coauthor, considering the nature
of their participation and their differing degrees of responsibility. The Committee
concluded that the coauthors of Hendrik Schön in the work in question have, in
the main, met their responsibilities, but that in one case questions remain that the
Committee felt unqualified to resolve, given the absence of a broader consensus
on the nature of the responsibilities of participants in collaborative research
endeavors.
II. Background
In late May 2002, the management of Bell Labs, Lucent Technologies, formed a
committee to investigate “the possibility of scientific misconduct, the validity of
the data and whether or not proper scientific methodology was used in papers by
Hendrik Schön, et al., that are being challenged in the scientific community”. The
full Charge to the Committee is attached in Appendix A. The members of the
Committee were M.R. Beasley (Chair), S. Datta, H. Kogelnik, H. Kroemer and D.
Monroe. Biographies of the Committee members can be found in Appendix B.
 4 
In consultation with the Bell Labs management, the Committee elected to use the
U. S. Federal Policy on Research Misconduct as its guiding set of principles,
definitions and recommended practices in conducting its investigation. The
research in question was not Federally funded, and therefore the Federal policies
are not legally binding on Lucent Technologies. Nonetheless, the Committee and
Lucent agreed that these policies represent, in effect, a consensus view of the U.S.
scientific community on the issue of scientific misconduct. A copy of these
guidelines is attached in Appendix C.
III. Allegations
A. Establishing the Allegations
The first task of the Committee was to establish the specific allegations pertaining
to the possibility of scientific misconduct, the validity of the data, and whether or
not proper scientific methodology was used in the papers being questioned. This
task was complicated by the public nature of some of the allegations, and by
additional allegations that came to the attention of the Committee as the
investigation progressed.
In order to proceed in an orderly and fair manner, the Committee assembled a
comprehensive set of Allegations and Observations about the work in question,
based on (1) the report transmitted to the Committee by Bell Labs of their initial
inquiry into the allegations, (2) written communications sent directly to the
Committee, and (3) verbal communications taken to be credible by the
Committee. All of these allegations and observations can be tracked to an
identified individual (or individuals) and in most instances were accompanied by
significant documentation.
The Allegations and Observations document was intended as a thorough,
straightforward compilation of the allegations and observations received by the
Committee. It contains both entries that directly suggest scientific misconduct
and entries that note scientific or procedural issues that can reasonably be taken to
raise questions as to the validity of the data in the works in question. These
allegations and observations were organized into categories that reflect both their
character and their pertinence to the questions raised in the Charge to the
Committee.
The document was not intended to reflect any rank ordering or any other
judgment by the Committee regarding the allegations. Because allegations
continued to come to the attention of the Committee well into the investigatory
process, this Allegations and Observations document was updated continually as
needed, based on the judgment of the Committee. However, in view of the need to
 5 
proceed systematically, allegations brought to the Committee’s attention after
June 20, 2002, were not included in the investigation.
Importantly, the Allegations and Observations document served to establish a
specific list of papers and coauthors that were the focus of the investigation.
The final version of the Allegations and Observations document developed by the
Committee is attached in Appendix D. A Table of papers, coauthors and
associated allegations by category derived from this document is shown below;
the papers are also listed in Appendix F.
 Papers in Question (See last page)
B. Informing the Authors of the Papers in Question
In concert with the management of Bell Labs, all authors of the papers in question
were provided with a list of the allegations pertinent to them, along with a
redacted copy of the associated documentation that was consistent, to the greatest
extent possible, with confidentiality. This notification process was first
comprehensively performed in late June, and was subsequently performed in
particular instances, as warranted.
IV. Procedures Followed in the Investigation
A. Refinement of the Allegations
As the investigation proceeded, the Committee distilled the full list of Allegations
and Observations into a smaller Final List of Allegations based on its sense of the
importance and relevance of the allegations, and in light of the elements of its
charge. The Committee also eliminated allegations that could not be reasonably
adjudicated by the Committee, or were of a character best left to the scientific
community through its normal processes, or were of lesser importance in the
context of this investigation.
This Final List of Allegations is shown below. It contains 24 Final Allegations.
The Committee examined in detail each of these Final Allegations as described
below. An elaborated version of this List is attached in Appendix E. It includes
for each allegation a summary of the relevant evidence, the responses of the
authors of the papers in question (mainly Hendrik Schön) and a statement of the
conclusions reached by the Committee. The complete list of Papers in Question is
attached in Appendix F.

 B. Questionnaire
As a first means of collecting input from the various authors, the Committee sent
questionnaires to all coauthors. Using the information in the Table above, the
Committee defined three classes of coauthors: 1) Hendrik Schön, 2) Primary
Coauthors (Zhenan Bao, Bertram Batlogg, and Christian Kloc) and 3) Secondary
Coauthors (all others). Copies of the questionnaires sent to each class are
attached in Appendix G. Responses were received from all coauthors.
 C. Interviews
During the week of 22 July 2002 the Committee visited Bell Labs and conducted
interviews related to its investigation.

Extensive interviews were carried out with four of the coauthors of the papers in
question: Zhenan Bao, Bertram Batlogg. Christian Kloc and Hendrik Schön.
Prior to the interviews, letters describing the interview process, and the areas in
 7 
which the Committee was specifically seeking information, were sent to each
interviewee.
The interviews were divided into two parts. In the first part, the Committee
discussed the written responses to the questionnaire provided by each of these
coauthors. In the second part, the Committee described each of the relevant final
allegations, presented in detail the supporting evidence and discussed the
allegations and supporting material with each interviewee. The interviews were
both transcribed and recorded, with the consent of the interviewees.
The Committee also interviewed other individuals that it felt had useful
information to offer relevant to the investigation. They included John Rogers, Art
Ramirez, Horst Störmer, Ananth Dodabalapur and Ernst Bucher – the latter two
by telephone. These informational interviews were neither transcribed nor
recorded. The Committee also conducted an additional interview by telephone
with Bertram Batlogg. This telephone interview was recorded but not transcribed.
D. Review of the Report
All coauthors of the papers in question, and the management of Bell Labs, were
provided the opportunity to review the report of the Committee prior to its formal
submission and to submit written comments for inclusion in the report.
Responses were received from Hendrik Schön and Bertram Batlogg, and are
included in Appendix H.
V. Findings
Based on an examination of all available evidence, the Committee arrived at the
following findings.
A. General Findings
1) By all accounts, Hendrik Schön is a hard working and productive scientist.
Many coworkers, both from Konstanz and from Bell Labs, have attested to his
long hours in the lab, the many samples wired for measurements, extensive use of
deposition and measurement apparatus, and extended periods analyzing data at
the computer. They have also commended his modest and unpretentious style, and
his deep understanding of many aspects of condensed-matter physics. Moreover,
Hendrik Schön has undeniably demonstrated an ability to write coherent,
stimulating papers at a remarkable rate, an average of one paper every 8 days
during 2001.

 8 
Unfortunately, none of the authors of the testimonials was familiar with the
experiments being performed. None are therefore able to attest to the validity of
the data in the papers in question.
2) The works in question report accomplishments that, if valid, would represent a
remarkable number of major breakthroughs in condensed-matter physics and
solid-state devices, including organic field-effect transistors, organic singlemolecule transistors, organic junction lasers, field-induced high-temperature
superconductivity in various materials, plastic Josephson junctions and tunable
superconducting weak links.
The works in question represent less than a quarter of Hendrik Schön’s
publications as first author over the past five years. Many of the other papers also
claim significant breakthroughs.
3) The devices used in the work in question were (with a few exceptions)
fabricated by Hendrik Schön alone, with no participation by any coauthor or
colleague, either at Bell Labs or at the University of Konstanz, where much of the
work in question was physically carried out.
The starting materials used to fabricate devices for measurement were obtained
from various sources. The high-quality single crystals of organic materials that
enabled many of the experiments were grown by Christian Kloc, with the
exception of haloform-intercalated C60 crystals, which were prepared by Hendrik
Schön himself in Konstanz. The CaCuO2 crystals were provided by the coauthors
from France. Zhenan Bao provided and in some cases synthesized molecules for
self-assembled monolayers; other molecules were obtained by Hendrik Schön.
For some of the SAMFET work and the polythiophene work, thin-film layers were
deposited by Zhenan Bao as part of devices otherwise fabricated by Hendrik
Schön. Similarly, some thin films were deposited by Christian Kloc. Another
exception is the data in Figure 3 of the paper by Schön and Bao, Paper XVI, for
which the device was both fabricated and measured by Zhenan Bao.
Hendrik Schön was working at Konstanz while he was waiting for a visa to take
up a full-time position at Bell Labs. Also, the sputtering system used to make the
Al2O3 gate insulators critical to many of his devices was located there. At times,
when Hendrik Schön was at Bell Labs, he provided samples to Ortwin Schenker,
who deposited Al2O3 gate insulators and returned the samples for further
processing and measurement.
4) Physical measurements of the significant devices underlying all papers in
question were (with one exception) carried out by Hendrik Schön alone, with no
participation by any coauthor or other colleague.
The one exception is the set of measurements by Zhenan Bao in the paper
mentioned in the preceding finding.
 9 
5) No measurement or demonstration of a significant physical effect or device
characteristic (e.g., transistor action, quantum Hall effect plateau, light emission,
superconducting transition or Josephson junction behavior) was witnessed by any
coauthor or other colleague (with one exception), despite repeated requests in at
least two cases (laser action and superconductivity).
The one exception is the observation of Shubnikov-deHaas oscillations in
pentacene, reportedly witnessed by Bertram Batlogg.
6) No laboratory records (e.g., signed notebook, dated sheets of paper, or
data/sample logs) were systematically maintained by Hendrik Schön in the course
of the work in question, either with respect to samples, processing,
characterization or measurement.
Hendrik Schön maintains that his record keeping practices were not unique for
his Department within Bell Labs.
7) All primary electronic data files were deleted by Hendrik Schön. Current
records, provided in response to the Committee’s request for supporting
information on six papers, comprise only secondary, processed data kept in
numerous computer files and on loose sheets of paper – and these not
systematically so.
Hendrik Schön claims that he had insufficient storage capacity on the old
computer available to him and therefore deleted these files, although he
acknowledges that other back-up storage options were available. Bertram
Batlogg asserts that had this problem been brought to the attention of the
management of Bell Labs, they would surely have provided a better computer.
Note that the current state of these data records makes it impossible for the
committee to confirm or refute the scientific claims made in the papers in
question.
8) No working devices with which one might confirm claimed results are
presently available. In addition, no nonworking devices are available for
structural or other types of characterization. All of the hundreds of devices that
are claimed to have been studied were either damaged during measurement,
damaged in transit from Konstanz or simply discarded.
It should be noted that some (but not all) of the measurements are prone to
destroying samples for the purposes of additional physical measurement (e.g.,
when breakdown occurs at high gate voltages, or at the high current densities
required for light emission in transistor structures).
 10 
It should also be noted that two experts in their fields who spoke with the
Committee noted that they had seen data (unpublished) that in some cases showed
subtle features that, these experts believed, were unlikely to be known by nonexperts. In their minds such details lend credibility to the results.
Finally, it should be noted that in the course of its investigation the Committee
heard of two reports by researchers outside of Bell Labs of some success in
achieving conduction (but not, to date, superconductivity) in field-effect transistor
structures incorporating C60. The Committee also heard that attempts to
reproduce the very high breakdown strength gate insulators at Konstanz, using
the same equipment used by Hendrik Schön, have not been successful.
9) All figures in the papers in question were (with one exception) processed and
prepared by Hendrik Schön alone, with no direct physical participation by any
coauthor.
The one exception is Figure 3 in the paper by Schön and Bao mentioned above.
In some cases coauthors did discuss the general form of the figures and which
data should be included and which should not.
B. Findings Related to Possible Manipulation and
Misrepresentation of Data
The most serious allegations regarding the work in question relate to possible
manipulation and misrepresentation of data. These allegations speak directly to
the question of scientific misconduct. The Committee carefully investigated each
of these allegations. Specific findings for each allegation can be found in
Appendix E. Here we focus on the most substantial findings.
1) Substitution of data in the papers in question did occur in multiple instances.
Specific examples include:
• Substitution of whole figures, single curves and partial curves in
different or the same paper to represent different materials, devices or
conditions.
• Nontrivial alteration or removal of individual data points or groups of
data points within a data file.
Hendrik Schön acknowledges this substitution, alteration, and selection took
place, but states that their occurrence results from mistakes made either in
extracting the intended data from his database or by accident while examining
individual data points. In some instances the substitution of data has been noted
 11 
and challenged by other researchers. In light of these challenges, in some
instances the appropriate journals have been notified and new figures provided.
In no case was the substitution or alteration of data discussed with any coauthor
prior to publication.
2) Further examples of substitution and alteration of data include:

• Substitution of fitted or assumed mathematical functions (e.g., power
laws, sine functions, exponentials, exact zeros) where measured data
would be expected. In some cases, these surrogate data were spliced,
using unspecified matching procedures, with other surrogates or with real
measurements to create the overall curves that were presented.
• Selection of data for illustration of trends so as to match the expected
trend to within a few percent, even though the original data varied by more
than a factor of ten.
Hendrik Schön acknowledges these substitutions and alterations but states that
these practices were used for the purpose of achieving a better and/or more
convincing representation of the observed phenomena. In no case was such data
substitution or alteration discussed with any coauthor.
3) Instances in which the data in figures have characteristics that are manifestly
unreasonable also occurred. There are three types:
• Individual curves in different figures or even the same figure that are
identical in shape (e.g., simply shifted vertically) over their entire extent or
over only a portion of the curve.
• Statistical plots that are inconsistent with the unbiased sampling process
implied in the associated paper.
• Perfect numerical symmetry in measured data values for continuous
upward and downward sweeps in a control parameter.
The most serious example of the first type occurs in Fig. 2 of the paper on
superconductivity in polythiophene (Paper XXV), which shows the behavior of
the normal-state resistance as a function of temperature, for various field-effect
induced doping levels. The data points in the lower pair of curves differ from
each other only by an exactly constant scaling factor over the entire temperature
range, with the exception of the single pair of data points forming the lowtemperature ends of both curves. For the upper two curves, the portions below
60K differ from the lower curves only by a scaling factor.
Examples of the second type occur in two separate papers: i) an externally
circulated preprint on the deposition procedures and properties of the critically
 12 
important Al2O3 insulating layers used in the field-effect doping experiments in
question (Paper XXIV), and ii) in the paper on conductance quantization in
SAMFET devices (Paper XIII).
The histogram of breakdown strengths, in the gate insulator preprint, and the
distribution in the quantized conductance, in the SAMFET paper, each fit a
Gaussian distribution to a degree that is extremely improbable, given the number
of samples. In both of these cases, the expected deviation from the ideal is
determined by well known statistical principles, not from any details of the
measurement apparatus.
An example of the third type also occurs in the preprint on Al203 gate insulators.
It shows the reversible onset of conduction and then superconductivity in a fieldeffect doped material (unlabeled) as the gate voltage was ramped up and then
down continuously. Despite the continuous nature of the measurement, the
resistance data on the up and down sweeps are numerically identical to an
extremely high precision.
While acknowledging the problematic nature of these results, Hendrik Schön has
no explanation for how such problems arose.
C. Responsiveness of the Authors of the Papers in Question
1) In the course of the investigation and before, Hendrik Schön provided the
Committee and others with voluminous information regarding the questions at
issue in this investigation. However, with only one exception, he did not
volunteer information about questioned results or practices until confronted
with documentary evidence. In addition, in at least four cases, his initial
explanation was revised when presented with more detailed information.
The exception is that he volunteered that a Gaussian line shape was used to
“extrapolate” the laser output as shown in Figure 2 of Paper XIV.
The most important cases of revision are:
i) For the statistics of conductance quantization, he stated that the
original data were obscured by a (highly unusual) wide bar on the
histogram plot. When it was found that the original plotting file contained
no such data points to be obscured, he stated that the original file had
accidentally omitted every other point. (As it turns out, even this omission
does not resolve the problem of the improbable statistics.)
ii) When questioned in an email about the relative current drives of
drive and load transistors in inverter circuits, he responded that the
currents were matched. Such a selection procedure for transistors cannot
result in inverter gain greater than one, whereas Hendrik Schön claimed
 13 
a gain of 6-10. In later discussions, he stated that the transistors were not
matched, and were chosen unsystematically to give a large gain.
iii) For the normal state resistance of field-effect doped
superconducting thin films, several instances have been noted in which
the data follows a simple analytical form. In his initial response to the
Committee, Hendrik Schön described how the apparent smoothness of the
data could result from smoothing of real, noisy data points. However,
when faced with the reality that such smoothing could not explain the
extraordinary precision with which the data fit the analytic form, Hendrik
Schön acknowledged that the data were in fact spliced-in analytic
functions.
iv) In his initial response to the committee's list of Allegations and
Observations, Hendrik Schön described a theoretical fit to the
temperature-dependent mobility of pentacene, in which, the data and the
fit disagree by only 10-20%. However, when confronted during the
interview with evidence that the agreement between different fields was as
good as 0.1% for half of the data points, he admitted that the
"experimental" data was actually a theoretical curve.
2) The responses of all other coauthors were direct and required no later
modification.
VI. Conclusions
A. Scientific Misconduct and Failure to Follow Accepted
Scientific Practices
Based on its examination of all relevant factors, the Committee concludes that,
based on the preponderance of the evidence, Hendrik Schön committed scientific
misconduct as defined by the falsification or fabrication of data, such that the
research is not accurately represented in the research record. This occurred in 16
of the 24 cases (Final Allegations) that the Committee examined, some of which
were interrelated. He did this intentionally or recklessly and without the
knowledge of any of his coauthors. The remaining 8 cases, while troubling, do not
on their own provide compelling evidence of scientific misconduct. (See
Appendix E for details.)
The evidence that manipulation and misrepresentation of data occurred is
compelling. In its mildest form, whole data sets were substituted to represent
different materials or devices. Hendrik Schön acknowledges that the data are
incorrect in many of these instances. He states that these substitutions could have
occurred by honest mistake. The recurrent nature of such mistakes suggests a
 14 
deeper problem. At a minimum, Hendrik Schön showed reckless disregard for the
sanctity of data in the value system of science. His failure to retain primary data
files compounds the problem.
More troublesome are the substitution of single curves, or even parts of single
curves, in multiple figures representing different materials or devices, and the use
of mathematical functions to represent real experimental data. Hendrik Schön
acknowledges these practices in many instances, but states that they were done to
achieve a more convincing representation of behavior that was nonetheless
observed. Such practices are completely unacceptable and represent scientific
misconduct.
One of the most troublesome cases is that of superconductivity in polythiophene.
Here, identical curves appear multiple times, in whole or in part, in a single
figure. Hendrik Schön acknowledges that these data are not valid but cannot
explain how they arose. In the view of the Committee, it is not possible that this
set of curves represent real data and therefore this is a clear, unambiguous case of
scientific misconduct.
Similarly, the statistics of the breakdown strengths of Al2O3 gate insulators are so
improbable that the results as a whole must be drawn into question. While it is
true that these data appear only in a preprint, this preprint was widely available
and was produced as a means of quelling the growing frustration of researchers in
the field by providing details on how to obtain such large breakdown fields. The
large breakdown fields were, in turn, indispensable for producing the many
unprecedented, and unrepeated, results on field-induced superconductivity.

The Committee further concludes that Hendrik Schön did not follow generally
accepted practice in his field with regard to the maintenance of traceable records
(in particular for critical results) nor did he retain original data in a form with
which critical physical claims could be verified, or even examined.
As a result it is not possible to confirm or to refute the fundamental physical
claims in the papers in question -- claims that Hendrik Schön maintains are valid
despite admitted manipulation and misrepresentation of data, which he
acknowledges he should not have done.
In the end, the correctness of the fundamental physical claims in the work in
question will come through the normal processes of science – specifically through
the reproduction, or not, of the results. On the basis of the evidence at hand, the
Committee cannot exclude the possibility that some of the specific results claimed
in the papers in question will someday be shown to be true. At the same time,
there is no basis to argue that all of the effects claimed are physically impossible.
Indeed, these general effects (perhaps differing in specific details) may be
demonstrated in the future by others in a fully independent way.
 15 
However, even if some of the claims in question turn out to be true, it would not
invalidate the conclusion that scientific misconduct occurred. It is the persistent,
intentional data manipulation and misrepresentation themselves, for whatever
reason, in presenting the claimed discoveries, not the ultimate validity of any or
all of those claims, that is at issue here. To apply a lesser standard would imply
that “ends justify the means”. This is unacceptable in reporting scientific results
and is at odds with the fundamental tenet of science that results must be presented
honestly, and in such a way that the reader can judge their validity on the merits.
The Committee finds all coauthors of Hendrik Schön in the work in question
completely cleared of any scientific misconduct. The Committee also finds no
evidence that the laboratory practices of any coauthor of Hendrik Schön, in the
work in question, are outside the accepted practices of their fields.
B. Responsibilities of Coauthors
The question of whether the coauthors of Hendrik Schön exercised appropriate
responsibility, in ensuring the validity of the data and physical claims in the
papers in question, requires careful discussion. There is no implication here of
scientific misconduct; the issue is one of professional responsibility.
However, the Committee chose to include this issue in the report because
coauthors, through their explicit association with the papers, by implication
endorse the validity of the work. Moreover, the coauthors often have access to
technical details that other parties, such as management, referees, editors and
award committees do not have, and thus the coauthors represent the first line of
defense against misconduct. When that defense fails, as in this case, it
emphatically raises the question of whether the community has a right to expect
more from coauthors. The Committee hopes to stimulate a discussion of this
question, but no definitive resolution will be found here.
This issue of the responsibilities of coauthors in collaborative work is of particular
importance in the present era of increasing multidisciplinary research across fields
of science. The U. S. Federal Policy on Research Misconduct, being concerned
only with scientific misconduct in the most stringent sense, does not address this
broader issue. The Committee has not found any authoritative document,
prepared by an appropriate U.S. national body, that discusses comprehensively
the responsibilities of coauthors in collaborative work. The most explicit
expression found by the Committee has been given in guidelines issued by the
Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), the quasi-governmental German
research agency (http://www.dfg.de/aktuell/download/self_regulation.htm). In its
Recommendation 11, the DFG states flatly:
“Authors of scientific publications are always jointly responsible for their
content. A so-called "honorary authorship" is inadmissible.”
 16 
Joint responsibility could range from a hard-to-define collective responsibility all
the way to considering every coauthor to be fully responsible for everything in the
paper.
The Committee does not endorse the latter view that each coauthor is responsible
for the entirety of a collaborative endeavor: the relative responsibility of
researchers with very different expertise, seniority and levels of participation must
be considered, particularly in view of the increasing importance of
interdisciplinary research. The Committee has adopted, for working purposes, the
following minimal principles that it feels should be honored in collaborative
research:
• All collaborators share some degree of responsibility for the entirety of
any paper of which they are a co-author.
 • The relative responsibility among coauthors will vary. For example, the
nature of expertise, the centrality of individual contributions, and evident
leadership roles inevitably and appropriately play a role in determining both the
degree of responsibility, and the relative responsibility for different aspects of a
paper.
• Collaborative scientific research requires a high level of trust among the
participants. However, such trust must be balanced with a responsibility to ensure
the veracity of all results. Shared credit for the accomplishment must be matched
with shared responsibility.

Two corollaries follow from these principles: 1) Researchers unwilling or unable
to accept responsibility for a paper should not be coauthors and their contributions
should be recognized through an appropriate acknowledgement; 2) Every
coauthor should be given an opportunity to review the final draft of any
manuscript before the latter is submitted for publication and, as a rule, coauthors
should in turn insist on such an opportunity.
Based on these principles, the Committee assessed whether or not the individual
coauthors in the work in question met their respective responsibilities. We begin
with the principal coauthors.
Christian Kloc grew many single crystals that were absolutely essential to the
research in question. This clearly qualifies him as a coauthor in the large number
of papers on which he is listed. However, the field of physical measurements
where data manipulation and misrepresentation took place is outside his specific
expertise. It would be unreasonable to expect him to notice data
misrepresentations that were for so long missed by even experts in the field. On
balance the Committee concludes that Christian Kloc met reasonably his
responsibilities as a coauthor.
 17 
Zhenan Bao participated in a relatively small number of the papers in question. In
addition to synthesizing molecules for Hendrik Schön, she also prepared thin
films of organic material on patterned electrodes. One of the papers combined
quite reasonable electrical results that Zhenan Bao measured on her own
apparatus, on structures she fabricated, with spectacular measurements by
Hendrik Schön, on quite different structures he fabricated. The juxtaposition of
these results in a single, short paper, of which she was the corresponding author,
should perhaps have stimulated more critical attention on her part. Still, on
balance, the Committee concludes that Zhenan Bao met reasonably her
responsibilities as a coauthor, for reasons basically similar to those in the case of
Christian Kloc.
Turning to Bertram Batlogg, the Committee agrees with his emphasis on the
importance of trust in collaborative research, and it agrees that Bertram Batlogg
took appropriate action once explicit concerns had been brought to his attention,
beginning in the summer of 2001. To this extent, the Committee concludes that
Bertram Batlogg met his responsibilities as a coauthor.
On the other hand, the Committee felt the need to question whether Bertram
Batlogg, as the distinguished leader of the research, took a sufficiently critical
stance with regard to the research in question, even in the absence of direct
knowledge of the growing concerns. Should Batlogg have insisted on an
exceptional degree of validation of the data in anticipation of the scrutiny that a
senior scientist knows such extraordinary results would surely receive? Such
attention need not violate the spirit of trust. To the contrary: Unprecedented and
spectacular results are guaranteed to lead to serious critical inquiries from the
scientific community at large. A senior coauthor who has paid close attention to
the details of the work, who recognizes the fallibility of the experimental process
and the human beings carrying it out, and who has asked searching questions is
in a much better position to support his colleagues in defending the work.
In a similar spirit, but admittedly more difficult, should Batlogg have crossed the
line of trust and questioned the integrity of the data? After all, during the period
from 2000 to 2002, many condensed-matter physicists, with no specific vested
interest in the work in question, were becoming seriously skeptical about the
extraordinary rate of publication of spectacular results on extremely difficult
material systems, independent of any specific evidence of problems with the
data.
These are extraordinarily difficult questions, which go to the heart of what we as
a community of scientists expect of one another professionally, in the real world
within the context of a collaborative research endeavor. The Committee does not
consider itself qualified to make a specific judgment in this case, in the absence
of a broader consensus on the nature of the responsibilities of participants in
collaborative research endeavors.
 18 
In the case of other coauthors not specifically discussed, the Committee finds that
their role in the totality of the work in question was sufficiently limited, and in
some cases of such a highly specialized nature, that they are judged as having met
reasonably their responsibilities as coauthors.
C. A Closing Comment
The Committee is aware, through written and verbal communications, that there
are expectations by some in the scientific community and beyond that it will pass
judgment on questions that the Committee regards beyond its purview, given its
charge, authority and expertise – not to mention the limits of time. The
Committee was given considerable latitude to define the scope of its investigation.
Indeed, many crucial questions naturally arise, now that it has been established
that scientific misconduct occurred. Among these questions are: the validity of the
central observations for the papers in question; the validity of the other
groundbreaking papers by Hendrik Schön; the extent to which Bell Labs
management, the journals, and award committees performed properly; and the
evolving standards of scientific documentation in computerized laboratories.
As to the first issue, the Committee has said all that it feels can be said within the
constraints of its charge and the available evidence. As to the remaining issues,
these are matters appropriately left to the scientific community as a whole and to
the relevant institutions. The Committee’s task was to establish the facts
regarding scientific misconduct as quickly and as clearly as possible. It is hoped
that this report will provide a solid foundation on which to base any further
considerations.
VII. Acknowledgements
The Committee would like to thank the many members of the scientific
community who sent us thoughtful and detailed communications pertinent to the
investigation. The Committee would also like to thank Jean Ainge and Suzanne
Merten for their highly competent and always cheerful assistance throughout this
endeavor.
 19 
Appendix A: Charge to the Investigation Committee
The Investigation Committee has been convened by Bell Labs management to investigate
the possibility of scientific misconduct, the validity of the data and whether or not proper
scientific methodology was used in papers by Hendrik Schön et al. that are being
challenged in the scientific community. Bell Labs management takes these charges very
seriously and would like to get the facts on the table as quickly as possible. We have
asked for this objective and open review assuming that the authors of the papers in
question are innocent of any wrongdoing until proven otherwise. It is the prerogative of
the Investigation Committee to decide the scope of the investigation in terms of the body
of scientific work of Hendrik Schön and his coauthors, based on the allegations it has
received from Bell Labs and those which have been transmitted to it directly.
The Investigation Committee will report its findings in the form of a written report to
Cherry Murray, Physical Sciences Sr. VP, Bell Labs and Jeff Jaffe, President of Research
and Advanced Technologies, Bell Labs. We would like to have a fair, thorough and
objective report of the Committee’s findings by September 1, 2002. If, however, the IC
determines it needs more time to complete its report, we ask that the IC advise us.
In the interest of openness and scientific integrity, Bell Labs would like to make the
findings of the Investigation Committee as public as possible. As the report or its
appendices may contain either proprietary or confidential information, Lucent
Technologies reserves the right not to publicize those portions it deems either proprietary
or highly confidential. The Investigation Committee may also wish to write an executive
summary that does not contain proprietary or confidential information and therefore is
suitable for more general audiences.
The Investigation Committee is asked to conduct an investigation of the scientific papers
under question using appropriate guidelines such as those spelled out by the Office of
Scientific Integrity of the NIH or such other usual and customary practices as may be
used in research universities to respond to allegations of possible scientific misconduct.
The Investigation Committee will be given complete freedom to conduct any interviews
and to gather any evidence that it deems necessary in order to conduct a thorough and fair
investigation of the misconduct allegations, of the scientific methods and of the scientific
validity of the data under question as well as the soundness of the scientific findings
derived from the data.
The Investigation Committee will be provided any evidence, including proprietary
information that will be so labeled, that it deems relevant. The Investigation Committee
may not reveal Lucent proprietary information. If the Investigation Committee decides to
tape interviews or gather any material data or evidence, then at the conclusion of its work
this material and the original interview tapes will be owned and archived by Lucent Bell
Labs
 A-1 
Appendix A: Charge to the Investigation Committee
During the course of the investigation, the Investigation Committee will have the
assistance from Bell Labs of Jean Ainge, a staff person to take notes, keep records, etc. as
well as legal counsel on Lucent matters by two attorneys, Art Saiewitz and Bruce
Schneider.
In addition the Bell Labs Research management is always at the service of the
Investigation Committee should they require more information or access to data.
As an initial provision of materials to you, we will provide each committee member with
a CD with the following information burned into it:
1. Executive summary of external and internal allegations known to John Rogers
and Federico Capasso
2. List and copies of the papers mentioned in the allegations
3. Timeline of work on molecular materials by Hendrik Schön
4. Any external and internal allegations known to us as of May 24, 2002 involving
Schön and his collaborators work
5. Hendrick Schön written responses to allegations and supporting letters
6. List of ‘mistakes’ by Hendrik Schön sent by email to his management
7. A pdf file of best practices and research integrity policies for Fordham University
8. a timeline of papers published by H. Schön et al.
9. a compilation of the emails sent between John Rogers and Federico Capasso
relating to Schön and his work.
10. a compilation of John Rogers email to Hendrik Schön
11. a contact list of relevant people & phone numbers – coauthors, mentors, critics,
12. copies of the letters Bell Labs sent to the editors of Science, Nature, and Applied
Physics Letters stating that we are convening an external review committee.
13. copies of selected email correspondence between Hendrik and collaborators.
14. CV’s of Committee members
15. Bell Lab’s code of conduct policy
Again, this is a preliminary deliverable and Bell Labs will provide such other material the
Investigation Committee deems necessary for its work.
Formal Charge to the Committee:
1. Ascertain that the composition of the Committee will enable a fair, objective and
thorough scientific review of the work under question.
a. Reveal any conflicts of interest on the Committee that would impair a fair
and objective investigation
b. Assure that there is the correct mix of expertise on the committee to do a
thorough scientific review of the work
c. Add or remove committee members as needed, including for the addition
of other scientific or technical expertise, in consultation with the
agreement of Bell Labs management
 A-2 
Appendix A: Charge to the Investigation Committee
2. Review as the Investigation Committee deems necessary evidence such as papers,
lab practices, samples, notebooks, correspondence, etc. and conduct interviews of
people the committee deems relevant to doing a thorough scientific review of the
body of work.
3. Explore to the extent it deems necessary the allegations, examine the evidence in
depth, determine whether there are instances of possible misconduct, whether
there are additional instances that would broaden the scope beyond the initial
allegations and determine whether there is evidence of, scientific misconduct and,
if so to what extent (such as whether the preponderance of the evidence supports
an allegation), who was responsible, and its seriousness.
4. Make a record of all Committee meetings and conference calls
5. Document the Committee’s findings in a final report

IV. Herbert Kroemer
Dr. Herbert Kroemer is the Donald W. Whittier Professor of Electrical Engineering at the
University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB), where he has been since 1976. He also
holds an appointment at the Materials Department at UCSB.
Dr. Kroemer was born (1928) and educated in Germany. He received a Ph.D. in
Physics (Solid State Theory) in 1952 from the University of Göttingen, Germany, with a
dissertation on the theory of what would now be called hot-electron effects, in the thennew transistor. Since then, he has worked on the physics and technology of semiconductors and semiconductor devices in a number of research laboratories in Germany and the
U.S.:
1952/54 German Telecommunications Service Research Laboratory
(Fernmeldetechnisches Zentralamt), Darmstadt, Germany;
1954/57 RCA Laboratories, Princeton, NJ;
1957/59 Philips Research Laboratory, Hamburg, Germany;
1959/66 Varian Associates Central Research Laboratory, Palo Alto, CA;
1966/68 Fairchild R&D Laboratory, Palo Alto, CA;
1958/76 University of Colorado, Boulder, CO.
Dr. Kroemer is the originator of several device concepts, such as the drift-transistor
concept, the double-heterostructure injection laser, and other heterostructure concepts.
While working on the drift transistor concept during the early-50’s, he realized that the
incorporation of controlled energy gap variations into a bipolar transistor has the potential
of greatly expanding the performance limits of that device. In 1957, he generalized these
ideas to the concept that energy gap variations represent “quasi-electric” fields and
potentials, the use of which represents a powerful new design principle for semiconductor
devices in general. This work was basically the start of the heterostructure device physics
and technology of today, one of the central parts of modern semiconductor device physics
and technology. He also analyzed in detail a first application of this principle, in the form
of what has become known as the heterostructure bipolar transistor (HBT), an idea that
was beyond technological realization at the time. His 1963 proposal of the double
heterostructure laser, still seven years ahead of technological realization, was another
direct outgrowth of the 1957 work, with vast repercussions on today’s lightwave
technology.
During the ‘60s, Kroemer worked on microwave device problems, and in 1964 he
was the first to publish an explanation for the Gunn Effect. With the emergence of
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) in the mid-'70s, he returned to heterostructure devices,
especially to HBTs, to the further conceptual development of which he made several
contributions that continue to influence the experimental developments in that field. In
addition to his previously dominantly theoretical work, he also started to take an active
part in experimental heterostructure work by MBE, expanding quickly beyond HBTs into
 B-6 
Appendix B: Biographies
new kinds of quantum well and superlattice structures, and making several contributions
to the development of MBE technology itself, especially for unconventional materials
combinations, such as GaAs-on-Si growth, and InAs/AlSb heterostructures.
He is the author or a co-author of over 270 publications.
Dr. Kroemer has received numerous awards, honors, and recognitions:
1972 Fellow of the IEEE, and Fellow of the APS
1972 Chair, International Symposium on GaAs and Related Compounds
1973 J. J. Ebers Award of the IEEE "for outstanding technical contributions

his contributions to hot-electron effects, the Gunn Oscillator, and III-V
heterojunction devices, including the heterojunction laser”
1985 Honorary Doctorate of Engineering from the Technical University of
Aachen, Germany "in honor of his great merits in the understanding and the
technical introduction of heterojunction devices"

2002 IEEE Medal of Honor
Dr. Kroemer’s current research interests continue to be in semiconductor
heterostructures, ranging from their basic physics to their device utilization, especially in
the form of new quantum-effect structures that require heterostructures as an essential
structural element without which they could not be built.

Appendix C: U.S. Federal Policy on Research Misconduct1

I. Research2 Misconduct Defined
Research misconduct is defined as fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing,
performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results.
• Fabrication is making up data or results and recording or reporting them.
• Falsification is manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or
changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately
represented in the research record.3
• Plagiarism is the appropriation of another person’s ideas, processes, results, or words
without giving appropriate credit.
• Research misconduct does not include honest error or differences of opinion.
II. Findings of Research Misconduct
A finding of research misconduct requires that:
• There be a significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant research
community; and
• The misconduct be committed intentionally, or knowingly, or recklessly; and
• The allegation be proven by a preponderance of evidence.

III. Responsibilities of Federal Agencies and Research Institutions4
Agencies and research institutions are partners who share responsibility for the research
process. Federal agencies have ultimate oversight authority for Federally funded
research, but research institutions bear primary responsibility for prevention and
detection of research misconduct and for the inquiry, investigation, and adjudication of
research misconduct alleged to have occurred in association with their own institution.
 1
No rights, privileges, benefits or obligations are created or abridged by issuance of this policy
alone. The creation or abridgment of rights, privileges, benefits or obligations, if any, shall occur only
upon implementation of this policy by the Federal agencies.
 2
Research, as used herein, includes all basic, applied, and demonstration research in all fields
of science, engineering, and mathematics. This includes, but is not limited to, research in economics,
education, linguistics, medicine, psychology, social sciences, statistics, and research involving human
subjects or animals.

3
The research record is the record of data or results that embody the facts resulting from scientific inquiry,
and includes, but is not limited to, research proposals, laboratory records, both physical and electronic,
progress reports, abstracts, theses, oral presentations, internal reports, and journal articles.

4
The term “research institutions” is defined to include all organizations using Federal funds for research,
including, for example, colleges and universities, intramural Federal research laboratories, Federally
funded research and development centers, national user facilities, industrial laboratories, or other
research institutes. Independent researchers and small research institutions are covered by this policy.

 C-1 
Appendix C: U. S.Federal Policy on Research Misconduct
• Agency Policies and Procedures. Agency policies and procedures with regard to
intramural as well as extramural programs must conform to the policy described in
this document.
• Agency Referral to Research Institution. In most cases, agencies will rely on the
researcher’s home institution to make the initial response to allegations of research
misconduct. Agencies will usually refer allegations of research misconduct made
directly to them to the appropriate research institution. However, at any time, the
Federal agency may proceed with its own inquiry or investigation. Circumstances in
which agencies may elect not to defer to the research institution include, but are not
limited to, the following: the agency determines the institution is not prepared to
handle the allegation in a manner consistent with this policy; agency involvement is
needed to protect the public interest, including public health and safety; the allegation
involves an entity of sufficiently small size (or an individual) that it cannot
reasonably conduct the investigation itself.
• Multiple Phases of the Response to an Allegation of Research Misconduct. A
response to an allegation of research misconduct will usually consist of several
phases, including: (1) an inquiry – the assessment of whether the allegation has
substance and if an investigation is warranted; (2) an investigation – the formal
development of a factual record, and the examination of that record leading to
dismissal of the case or to a recommendation for a finding of research misconduct or
other appropriate remedies; (3) adjudication – during which recommendations are
reviewed and appropriate corrective actions determined.
• Agency Follow-up to Institutional Action. After reviewing the record of the
investigation, the institution’s recommendations to the institution’s adjudicating
official, and any corrective actions taken by the research institution, the agency will
take additional oversight or investigative steps if necessary. Upon completion of its
review, the agency will take appropriate administrative action in accordance with
applicable laws, regulations, or policies. When the agency has made a final
determination, it will notify the subject of the allegation of the outcome and inform
the institution regarding its disposition of the case. The agency finding of research
misconduct and agency administrative actions can be appealed pursuant to the
agency’s applicable procedures.
• Separation of Phases. Adjudication is separated organizationally from inquiry and
investigation. Likewise, appeals are separated organizationally from inquiry and
investigation.
• Institutional Notification of the Agency. Research institutions will notify the funding
agency (or agencies in some cases) of an allegation of research misconduct if (1) the
allegation involves Federally funded research (or an application for Federal funding)
and meets the Federal definition of research misconduct given above, and (2) if the
institution’s inquiry into the allegation determines there is sufficient evidence to
proceed to an investigation. When an investigation is complete, the research
institution will forward to the agency a copy of the evidentiary record, the
investigative report, recommendations made to the institution’s adjudicating official,
and the subject’s written response to the recommendations (if any). When a research
institution completes the adjudication phase, it will forward the adjudicating official’s
decision and notify the agency of any corrective actions taken or planned.
 C-2 
Appendix C: U. S.Federal Policy on Research Misconduct
• Other Reasons to Notify the Agency. At any time during an inquiry or investigation,
the institution will immediately notify the Federal agency if public health or safety is
at risk; if agency resources or interests are threatened; if research activities should be
suspended; if there is reasonable indication of possible violations of civil or criminal
law; if Federal action is required to protect the interests of those involved in the
investigation; if the research institution believes the inquiry or investigation may be
made public prematurely so that appropriate steps can be taken to safeguard evidence
and protect the rights of those involved; or if the research community or public should
be informed.
• When More Than One Agency is Involved. A lead agency should be designated to
coordinate responses to allegations of research misconduct when more than one
agency is involved in funding activities relevant to the allegation. Each agency may
implement administrative actions in accordance with applicable laws, regulations,
policies, or contractual procedures.

IV. Guidelines for Fair and Timely Procedures
The following guidelines are provided to assist agencies and research institutions in
developing fair and timely procedures for responding to allegations of research
misconduct. They are designed to provide safeguards for subjects of allegations as well
as for informants. Fair and timely procedures include the following:
• Safeguards for Informants. Safeguards for informants give individuals the
confidence that they can bring allegations of research misconduct made in good faith
to the attention of appropriate authorities or serve as informants to an inquiry or an
investigation without suffering retribution retribution. Safeguards include protection
against retaliation for informants who make good faith allegations, fair and objective
procedures for the examination and resolution of allegations of research misconduct,
and diligence in protecting the positions and reputations of those persons who make
allegations of research misconduct in good faith.
• Safeguards for Subjects of Allegations. Safeguards for subjects give individuals the
confidence that their rights are protected and that the mere filing of an allegation of
research misconduct against them will not bring their research to a halt or be the basis
for other disciplinary or adverse action absent other compelling reasons. Other
safeguards include timely written notification of subjects regarding substantive
allegations made against them; a description of all such allegations; reasonable access
to the data and other evidence supporting the allegations; and the opportunity to
respond to allegations, the supporting evidence and the proposed findings of research
misconduct (if any).
• Objectivity and Expertise. The selection of individuals to review allegations and
conduct investigations who have appropriate expertise and have no unresolved
conflicts of interests help to ensure fairness throughout all phases of the process.
• Timeliness. Reasonable time limits for the conduct of the inquiry, investigation,
adjudication, and appeal phases (if any), with allowances for extensions where
appropriate, provide confidence that the process will be well managed.
• Confidentiality During the Inquiry, Investigation, and Decision-Making Processes.
To the extent possible consistent with a fair and thorough investigation and as
allowed by law, knowledge about the identity of subjects and informants is limited to
 C-3 
Appendix C: U. S.Federal Policy on Research Misconduct
those who need to know. Records maintained by the agency during the course of
responding to an allegation of research misconduct are exempt from disclosure under
the Freedom of Information Act to the extent permitted by law and regulation.

V. Agency Administrative Actions
• Seriousness of the Misconduct. In deciding what administrative actions are
appropriate, the agency should consider the seriousness of the misconduct, including,
but not limited to, the degree to which the misconduct was knowing, intentional, or
reckless; was an isolated event or part of a pattern; or had significant impact on the
research record, research subjects, other researchers, institutions, or the public
welfare.
• Possible Administrative Actions. Administrative actions available include, but are
not limited to, appropriate steps to correct the research record; letters of reprimand;
the imposition of special certification or assurance requirements to ensure compliance
with applicable regulations or terms of an award; suspension or termination of an
active award; or suspension and debarment in accordance with applicable
government-wide rules on suspension and debarment. In the event of suspension or
debarment, the information is made publicly available through the List of Parties
Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs maintained by
the U.S. General Services Administration. With respect to administrative actions
imposed upon government employees, the agencies must comply with all relevant
federal personnel policies and laws.
• In Case of Criminal or Civil Fraud Violations. If the funding agency believes that
criminal or civil fraud violations may have occurred, the agency shall promptly refer
the matter to the Department of Justice, the Inspector General for the agency, or other
appropriate investigative body.

VI. Roles of Other Organizations
This Federal policy does not limit the authority of research institutions, or other entities,
to promulgate additional research misconduct policies or guidelines or more specific
ethical guidance.

Appendix D: Allegations and Observations
[The following is the list of allegations and observations (which may fall short of being
allegations) maintained by the committee, as of June 20, 2002. The summaries listed
were condensed from the full statements made by the sources of the allegations. The
Committee has maintained records of these sources, as indicated by the letters, and the
original statements. The identity of these sources, and the full statements, are not
included in this report.]
Comments on the Allegations/Observation Document
This document is intended as a thorough, straightforward compilation of the allegations
and observations received by the Investigation Committee prior to June 20, 2002 bearing
on possible scientific misconduct by the authors indicated. It is based on the report
transmitted to the Committee by Lucent Technologies of their initial inquiry into the
allegations, written communications sent directly to the Committee, and verbal
communications taken to be credible by the Committee.
It contains both entries that suggest directly scientific misconduct and entries that note
scientific issues that can reasonably be taken to raise questions as to the validity of the
data.
The document does not reflect any rank ordering or any other judgment by the
Committee regarding the allegations.
I. Experimental data matching theory too well
Normal state resistance of C60 films

 D-1 
Appendix D: Allegations and Observations
• Pentacene mobility data4
 matches theory too well
• Ballistic transport peaks
5
 match theory too well
 Dilution series
[From Source A; adopted as Allegation XVI]
Dilution series in SAMFETs (Ref. 6, Inset of Fig. 1(B)) shows perfect agreement down
N=1, when Poisson statistics would predict sometimes 0, sometimes 2. No indication of
distribution of results.
Conductance quantization
[From Source D; adopted as Allegation XV]
Histograms of conductances in single-molecule6
 have much too little variance, and
shapes of individual distributions are much too perfect (χ2
 ~ .08). Explanation after this
was challenged: bar width of histogram was much wider than spacing (about five bins)
which distorted statistics. Original data may have been replaced, however.
 Width series
[From Source D; adopted as allegation XVII]
Width series for SAMFETs (unpublished7
, produced after width dependence was
questioned) implies a very small process bias (~0.01µm) for a presumably crude process.

Space-charge limited I-V
[From Source B; adopted as Allegation VI]
Substantially the same data (space-charge-limited current I-V) in two papers, represented
as different materials:
• Ref. 18, Fig. 2, top graph, top curve, α-6T
• Ref. 19, Fig. 2: pentacene
Laser emission spectrum
[From Source C; adopted as Allegation VII]
Substantially the same data (emission spectra) represented as two different temperatures

 Superconducting Tc versus charge

Appendix D: Allegations and Observations
Curves of resistance versus temperature for different gate-induced charge densities are
very similar, up to a multiplicative factor, at low temperatures. For the two metallic
densities, the resistance is the same, up to a multiplicative factor for all temperatures,
except where one sample is superconducting.
• Ref. 24, Fig. 2
III. Results in conflict with known physics
SAMFET subthreshold swing
[From Sources, A, D, M, N, and Q; adopted as Allegation XX]
Subthreshold swing of ~30mV/decade is not physically consistent with MOSFET
physics, which should not be capable of being steeper than 60mV/decade. For the
nominal structure, with a 2nm channel and a 30nm gate oxide, the effect of the gate
voltage on the channel potential should be reduced by a more than an order of magnitude,
but the device turns off as it should and has a high transconductance.
Gate coupling of single molecules
[From Source B; partially incorporated into Allegation XX]
Curves are said to represent contributions from molecules at different positions, but they
manifest the same gate voltage. Transconductance larger than could be expected from an
individual molecule, even perfectly coupled to the gate.
Gating of resonant tunneling current
[From Source N; not adopted since it was related to unpublished work]
Gating25 of resonant tunneling current (unpublished?) makes no sense, since the current is
represented as a phenomenon of the whole film.
Unipolar inverter characteristics
[From Sources P, Q, and S; adopted as Allegation XIX]
The width ratio of the inverters is not specified, although private communications
indicate “matched” transistors were used. If this were true, there is no way to get a gain
greater than one (required for cascading) using the same transistor for load and drive. The
inverter characteristics represented as coming from single transistor polarity are much
more consistent with complimentary transistors.

25 “Nanoelectronic Devices Based on Molecular Heterostructures,” J. H. Schön,*, Günther Götz,
and P. Bäuerle, unpublished.
D-5 
Appendix D: Allegations and Observations
 Kondo temperature
[From Source G; not adopted since it relates to unpublished work]
The known energy scales lead to the conclusion that the Kondo temperature should be
tens of orders of magnitude too small to be measured, in contrast to the unpublished
claim of tens of Kelvin.
 Laser threshold
[From Source C; not adopted since it may be a legitimate scientific question]
Claimed threshold of laser is too low to be consistent with constraints relating
spontaneous and stimulated emission.
Hysteretic planar Josephson junctions
[From Source H; adopted as Allegation XXI]
Josephson junctions26 are supposed to be SNS type, but look like textbook tunnel
junctions. Hysteresis appears inconsistent with capacitance of structure.
 Sub-gap conductance
[From Sources H and I; adopted as Allegation XXII]
Low sub-gap quasiparticle conductance27 reported even at a temperature that is a
significant fraction of Tc of polythiophene. Other aspects remarkably good as well. Peaks
in d2
I/dV2 should be dips if they represent phonon modes as claimed.
 Squid results
[From Sources H and I; adopted as part of allegation XXIII]
Periodicity of oscillations27 does not, in fact, match the stated area of 10um2
, and extends
over more periods than would be expected given the sketch of the structure.
IV. Unusual fabrication and procedures
 SAMFET structure
[From Source D; relevant to Allegation XX but not specifically pursued]
Figure 1 of Ref. 14 describes MOSFET formed on sidewall of trench. Detailed questions
reveal that the angled deposition of the first gold film should result in a MOSFET on the
bottom of the trench.

26 “Josephson Junctions with Tunable Weak Links,” Jan Hendrik Schön, Christian Kloc, Harold Y. Hwang,
Bertram Batlogg, Science 292, 252 (13 April 2001). (Paper XVII)
27 “Plastic Josephson junctions,” Jan Hendrik Schön, Appl. Phys. Lett. 14, 2208 (11 October 2001). (Paper
XVIII)
D-6 
Appendix D: Allegations and Observations
Shadowing effects of angled evaporation of second gold film due to first gold film
thickness (not specified in paper) should lead to a channel length determined by
geometry, not the molecularly defined channel length which is the central point of the
entire body of work.
No microscopy or other evidence that the SAMFET structure is as described in the
schematic drawing.
 Gate dielectric
[From Sources J, K, O, and S; adopted as part of Allegation XVIII]
Subsequent analysis indicates that Al2O3 films are an order of magnitude thicker than
claimed. Possible lack of proper calibration procedures for film thicknesses suggested.
 Self-assembled monolayers
[From Source L; not adopted since it may be a legitimate scientific question]
Ordering of self-assembled monolayers is usually poor for fewer than 18-carbon alkyl
groups.
Molecules with a thiol group on each end are often found to bond both ends to a gold
surface.
 Adding conductances
[From Source D; included in Allegation XV]
Histograms of conductancesin single molecule work (Ref. 15, Fig. 3) were sometimes
computed by adding peak values for multiple peaks.
 Discarding data
[From Source M; included in Allegation XV]
The bar graph of conductances has no tail in what otherwise might look like a Poisson
distribution. When asked, Schön said that he threw out conductances in those bins.
 Inferred mobility
[From Source N, included in Allegation XX]
Horizontal SAMFET results28 are said to be similar in mobility to vertical ones, but
current is three times smaller and width is said to be 25µm instead of 0.8µm. Total
difference in current density should be more like two orders of magnitude, so how can the
mobility similar? In the apparently duplicated figures, the data are exactly the same, but
the reported mobilities for the different materials are all different.
 Low yield
[From Source D; not specifically included in allegations]

28 “Nanoscale organic transistors based on self-assembled monolayers,” J. H. Schön and Z. Bao, Appl.
Phys. Lett. 80, 847 (4 February 2002). (Paper XVI)
D-7 
Appendix D: Allegations and Observations
Low yield in SAMFETs could allow for personal bias in choice of results. No description
of protocols used for what was included or excluded.
Unusual operating voltages
[From Source Q; included in Allegation XIX]
If the transistors used in the inverter can be operated at 2V14, why weren’t they
characterized at that voltage in the triode data?
Unusual data acquisition
[From Source D; not specifically included in allegations]
SdH data (Ref. 22) are sampled very coarsely, unusual because of eddy-current
heating.Almost all plots (versus temperature, carrier density per C60, etc) have the same
abscissa for all curves, with all points at very round numbers.
V. Unusually good results
 Conductance quantization
[From Sources D, Q; relevant to Allegation XV]
Quantization of conductance (unpublished?) is surprisingly good (a few percent?)
Gate dielectric films
[From Sources D, J; relevant to Allegation XVIII]
Al2O3 breakdown strength is twice that of other workers. Pulled paper called
“sputtering.doc”29 shows detailed justification of this, including a dense 12x12 matrix
study as a function of deposition rate and pressure (144 depositions!). The signal to noise
is totally out of character for processing studies, and can even be plotted on a contour
plot.
On characteristics of SAMFETs
[From Source D; relevant to Allegation XX]
Transconductance of SAMFETs14 implies extraordinary velocity, ballpark 2x109
cm/s
[=(17mA/V)/0.8µm) x(30nm)/(3.9)/8.85x10-14
F/cm)], for a cutoff frequency fT of 10,000
GHz.
Leakage current of organic films
[From Sources A, B; included in Allegation XX]

29 “Sputtering of alumina thin films for field-effect doping,” J. H. Schön
D-8 
Appendix D: Allegations and Observations
Off-current (leakage) of SAMFETs14 is 2-3 orders of lower than careful scanning probe
measurements on similar systems
Uniformity of electrical properties
[From Source D; relevant to several Allegations but not specifically included]
Resolving the number of molecules in the diluted SAMFETs14 requires uniform
conductance per molecule of a few percent, and threshold to about 20mV, both
extraordinary.
Fractional Quantum Hall Effect
[No specific Allegations were identified]
Fractional QHE 22 and especially the unpublished data.
 Superconducting junctions
[Relevant to Allegations XXI, XXII, and XXIII]
Weak link and squid results26,27
.
Superconductivity in gated fullerenes
[Relevant to Allegations VIII, X, and XI]
Superconducting Tc in both pure1 and expanded fullerenes21
 Laser action
[Relevant to Allegation VII]
Light emission and lasing20.
Mobility of organic crystals
[Relevant to Allegations XIII and XIV]
The very high mobility4 of the acene crystals (attributed to the high crystal quality, which
is not without precedent).
 Conductance quantization
[Relevant to Allegation XV]
Since the conductance peaks15 are shown as not flat-top, there is no reason why they
should be quantized, especially to the accuracy claimed.
Similarity of different molecules
[Not pursued as possibly a legitimate scientific issue]
Surprisingly consistent behavior of different molecules in SAMFETs.
D-9 
Appendix D: Allegations and Observations
 Threshold voltages
[Not pursued as possibly a legitimate scientific issue]
Threshold voltages are always exactly where one would like them to be, although no
obvious thought has been given to how to adjust them.
Scatter of conductance quantization
[Relevant to Allegation XV]
Width of conductance peaks does not grow as the number of molecules contributing
increases.
 Squid results
[From source I; included in Allegation XXIII]
Perfect oscillations over many periods, although the schematic device structure would
suggest single-junction interference at a few periods.
VI. Data similar to that of other workers
 Inverter data
[Not pursued since the similarities were not compelling]
Inverter data mentioned above are similar in threshold and overall gain to work of Lin et
al. (Ref. 30). (Gain of all of the inverters is 6.6).
VII. Plagiarism
 Vertical MOSFETs
[From Source D; not pursued as not being particularly egregious]
Whole sentence in Ref. 14 lifted from Hergenrother et al.31
VIII. Overall discomfort issues
 Number of papers

Overall volume of output is phenomenal.
 Number of samples
[From Sources D, Q; relevant to Allegations XV, XVI, XVII, and XVIII]
The statistical studies of the diluted SAMFETs15 involve hundreds of samples, probed at
4K. The yield is said to be less than 10% for the normal SAM layers, even lower for the
diluted films. How were the required thousands of low-temperature measurements
performed?
Number of experiments done29 to characterize the Al2O3 films is huge.
 Isolation
[From Source S; relevant to many allegations, but none specifically]
In the majority of papers, Hendrik is the first author and the only one doing
measurements. In many cases, he is also doing the device fabrication as well.
Much of the work was done in Germany, not seen by the collaborators.
 Reproducibility
[From Source S; relevant to many allegations, but none specifically]
Attempts to reproduce the samples in Murray Hill have not been successful, in particular
the crucial deposition of the dielectric for gating carrier concentration.
Outside workers appear to have been unable to reproduce results.
Samples are said not to survive long enough in air to be remeasured, or are subjected to
destructive experiments.
Poor record keeping
[From Source S; relevant to many allegations, but none specifically]
Reportedly, no lab notebooks are kept.
 Too lucky
[From Source D; relevant to many allegations, but none specifically]
A large fraction of the reports include results that are either much better than previously
published, reveal or require new physics, or both.
Many enabling aspects of the devices (dielectric breakdown strength, gold morphology,
film morphology and ordering, purity of samples, scattering rates, non-radiative lifetimes,
parasitic leakages, etc.) are much better than obtained by other workers. There is no
indication of special effort being expended to achieve these advances, nor does there
appear to be time to optimize them.
New structures and experiments appear to work as expected the first time.
Disregard for context
[From Source D; relevant to many allegations, but none specifically]
D-11 
Appendix D: Allegations and Observations
High level of comfort by authors with results that violate physical constraints or are
inconsistent with other work. Even after serious errors or distortions are revealed, errata
or corrections are not sent to journals. Little follow-up, in the sense of exploring the
reproducibility or systematics of experiments. Next paper is usually a totally new
breakthrough.
Availability of equipment and supplies
[From Source T; not pursued as too difficult to determine]
Some of the specialized apparatus for making the measurements may not have been
available to Hendrik. Liquid Helium consumption may not have been adequate.

Appendix E: Elaborated Final List of Allegations
In this Appendix, we present and discuss the Final List of Allegations that the
Committee distilled from the full set of Allegations and Observations (Appendix D).
The allegations are grouped into the broad categories described in the main body of the
text of this report: data substitution, unreasonable precision, and contradictory physics.
In each case, we detail the allegation and present a summary of the evidence that the
Committee has established relevant to the allegation. We also summarize the responses
obtained in the interviews (primarily those of Hendrik Schön) and state a conclusion with
regard to each allegation.
The evidence was acquired from various sources. These include the report of the
inquiry carried out by the Bell Laboratories management, related electronic files such as
PowerPoint™ presentations provided by Lucent, the supporting documentation provided
by those raising the allegations and the Committee’s own examination of the materials it
was provided. Critical, in many cases, was the availability of drafts of the various journal
publications under question, in electronic form (Microsoft Word™). The published
figures were often identical to those in the drafts, in which case it was possible to extract
the precise, numerical data underlying the published figures. These data, referred to in
this Appendix as “original plotting data”, were included as embedded files associated
with the Origin™ data processing and plotting program used by Hendrik Schön. In a few
cases, the electronic draft was not available, but a clearly related figure was found
embedded in a PowerPoint file, or in a freestanding Origin file; these cases are noted in
the text. Note that the Committee established as part of its investigation that all the
figures in the papers under question were (with one exception) created by Hendrik Schön
alone, with no active participation by any of the coauthors. Most of the figures based on
original plotting data extracted from electronic documents were shown to Hendrik Schön
during the interviews. Only in the case of Allegation XI (C70) did he raise an objection to
the use of these embedded data as proxies for the published data.
The allegations raise suspicions about various aspects of the work in question.
Although the evidence suggesting a problem differs in the various cases, the underlying
scientific misconduct that is being alleged is essentially the same: knowingly or recklessly
publishing data that is not what it is represented to be.
E-2 
Appendix E: Elaborated Final List of Allegations
Evaluating these allegations involves three questions:
a) Is there clear evidence that the data do not come from the
measurements described?
This evidence takes different forms: Data Substitution, in which data sets for
distinct experimental conditions show unreasonable similarity to each other, in some
cases after multiplying one data set by a constant factor; Unreasonable Precision, in
which a data set agrees better with a simple analytic expression than would be expected
from the measurement accuracy; and Contradictory Physics, in which the data appear to
be inconsistent with prevailing scientific understanding and the description of the
measurement. Many great discoveries in science would at first have been included in the
Contradictory Physics category, so the Committee has set aside all but a few especially
problematic examples. However, extraordinary results demand extraordinary proof.
Unless special diligence is demonstrated, results that contradict known physics are just as
likely to suggest simple error, self-deception or misrepresentation of data. For final
judgement of the validity of the observations, however, the Committee defers to the
scientific community.
Other types of evidence, while important, are difficult to decide definitively and
have not been considered in detail. These include failure of others to reproduce the work,
results that are much better than others have achieved, and a pace of breakthroughs and a
success rate that far surpass other workers.
The Committee has limited its investigation to data for which concrete, objective
evidence to doubt the validity was brought to its attention prior to June 20, 2002.
b) If the data are not valid, are there mitigating circumstances
that explain how the data came to be misrepresented?
For example, a clerical error in including the wrong data in a figure represents
poor procedures, but not misconduct. Unfortunately, such innocent explanations tend to
require an understanding of the state of mind of the authors at the time the data were
prepared, and this cannot be determined definitively. It must be noted that it is natural
and appropriate that the credibility of a particular innocent explanation depends on the
overall credibility of the scientist in question. This in turn depends on whether there is an
E-3 
Appendix E: Elaborated Final List of Allegations
unreasonable number of problems or a pattern of questionable practices. This is not a
case of many poorly founded allegations being accepted as proof that “something must be
wrong.” Rather, the problems with the data are already established, and the question is
whether many improbable, innocent explanations should be accepted.
c) Can the data presented be traced back to primary data, free of
any data processing or other manipulation?
It is a well-established tenet of science that clear records should be kept. At the
end of the day, only credible, primary data can provide unambiguous corroborating
evidence for published data. An understanding of the procedures of data acquisition and
analysis also provides a context within which possibly mitigating circumstances can be
assessed. It is worth emphasizing that the retention of primary data, together with
adequate record keeping, are necessary to the ordinary conduct of science, not simply for
the examination of possible wrongdoing. Frequently, in the conduct of research, new
questions arise that require a revision of the original analysis, and thus require a return to
the primary data. Failure to keep primary data and records for a reasonable time is, by
itself, a threat to the health of the scientific enterprise. This remains as true in the
computer age as it has been in the past.

solid symbols are within the open symbols,
and agree with each other to five significant
figures, although they represent distinct data
sets.
 Allegation
Very similar data (transistor
triode curves), including detailed
“noise,” appear in two different figures
in the same paper, represented as two
different molecules making up the
Self-Assembled Monolayer Field
Effect Transistor (SAMFET). The
vertical scale differs by a factor of two,
and some curves are present in only
one figure.

E-5 
Appendix E: Elaborated Final List of Allegations
The Committee obtained the original plotting data for the two graphs. Those data,
for gate voltages of –0.2 V, –0.4 V , and 0.6 V are replotted on the same scale in Figure
3. To make this plot, the data from Fig. 3 of the paper have been divided by exactly a
factor of 2. In addition, the data are plotted out to a drain voltage of –1.0 V (the data were
present in the file but were only displayed to –0.6 V in the original figure). A few points
near the origin are different, but the remainder of the data for all three gate voltages are in
perfect agreement. Examination of the underlying data shows that the agreement extends
to five significant figures, well beyond any reasonable instrumental precision.
The presence of an identical figure in a context representing it as different data is
troubling, since the purpose of figures in journals is to show what the measurements
objectively reveal. It is possible to imagine that a clerical error could cause an entire
identical figure to be placed in a manuscript in the wrong position; even one such
occurrence would indicate a level of sloppiness that would begin to undermine the
credibility of other data. However, it is difficult to understand how the data could be
accidentally manipulated to: (1) remove some curves (2) scale the data by a factor of two
(3) change the range of the plot to obscure some real data, and (4) alter some data points.
The same triode data for the SAMFET also
appears to match other, much older data, represented as
different materials:

characteristics from
“SAMFET” Paper (XII). The
figure has been compressed
horizontally for comparison.

Appendix E: Elaborated Final List of Allegations
• “SAMFET” Paper (XII), Fig. 2, SAMFET (see Figure 4).
• “AmbipolarPentacene” Paper (II), Fig. 2 lower: pentacene (see Figure 6).
• “SuperFETswitch” Paper (III), Fig. 1 lower, and “BandlikeC60” Paper (XX),
Fig. 2 lower: C60 (see Figure 5).
Comparing these figures shows that: the vertical scales are different by integer
factors; the horizontal scale is different by an integer factor for the SAMFET paper; the
sign of the voltage has been changed; the labels have been changed; some of the noise
details on the data are different, while others appear to be the same.
 Response
Hendrik Schön’s states that “AmbipolarPentacene” and “SuperFETswitch” data
are not identical. No primary data for any of these curves, nor the electronic versions of
the last two figures, could be found. Hendrik Schön acknowledged that multiplication of
curves by a factor of two was occasionally employed for comparing SAMFETs of
different nominal width (the overall current should be proportional to the width; it is
common to plot the drive current of transistors per micron of device width). Hendrik
Schön acknowledged the alteration of individual data points as an accidental consequence
of using the “move” function to interrogate points in the Origin plotting program, instead
of the more straightforward “read” function.
 Conclusion
It is undeniable that the two figures in the SAMFET paper contain the same data.
The scale change, multiplication by an integer, missing curves, and limited plotting range
make an innocent explanation not credible.
For the other set of three figures, in the absence of the underlying data, the
similarity of the data, including the “noise,” is compelling, but not definitive. This
substitution was done either intentionally or recklessly.
The preponderance of evidence indicates that Hendrik Schön committed scientific
misconduct, specifically data falsification, in this case.

II. Data Substitution: Ambipolar triode characteristics

“LightEmitting” Paper (V), Fig. 1.:
“alpha-sexithiophene (α-6T)”
Figure 8. Triode characteristic from
“Perylene” (VI), Fig. 2: “perylene”.
Note the sign change from Figure 7. One
curve is missing.
 Allegation
Very similar data (ambipolar transistor
triode characteristics), including similar details of
the “noise,” are represented as different
materials, and with voltages changed, in three
papers.
Figure 9. Triode characteristic from
Paper (VIII), “AmbipolarOrganic”,
Fig. 2: “pentacene.”
• “LightEmitting” Paper (V), Fig. 1: α-6T (see
Figure 7). The positive polarities of gate and
drain voltage are appropriate for an n-channel
device. For gate voltage below 4 V, and large
drain voltages, extra conduction attributed to
electrons is observed.
• “Perylene” Paper (VI), Fig 2: perylene (see Figure 8). The gate and drain voltage and
the drain current are listed with the opposite polarity, appropriate for a p-channel
device. The positions of the labels are the same. In addition, the gate voltage labels
have been modified, from 5V to –4V, 4V to –2V, and 3V to –1V; the 2V curve is
missing altogether.
E-8 
Appendix E: Elaborated Final List of Allegations
• “AmbipolarOrganic” Paper (VIII), Fig. 2: pentacene (see Figure 9). This figure is
identical to the preceding one, except that the sign of the current is now listed as
positive (potentially a question of definition), and the material is different.
As discussed in the previous allegation, the clear repetition of data in different
materials over an extended period, by itself, calls into question the record-keeping
process, and the credibility of this and other data. However, the figures evince detailed
modifications of the plot, including changes in the sign of gate and drain voltage and
drain current, as well as the changed labels on the plots and the removal of a data set. The
polarity of the carriers is of central importance in organic conductors, for which it is
common that only one polarity is mobile. Such manipulation appears to be inconsistent
with even the sloppiest “clerical” error.
 Response
Hendrik Schön has acknowledged data substitution between “Perylene” and
“LightEmitting” papers. He acknowledged a procedure in which he selected data that
looked appropriate for the device and material in question. The figures would then be
relabeled, without due diligence to determine if the data were really taken from that
device and material. He stated in the interview, “I know that I had an Origin file which is
called I think ‘ambipolar’ where I put in transistor characteristics of ambipolar devices
and in most of the cases when I write a paper or prepare a manuscript, I normally have an
idea what kind of figures I want to put in those papers and I would take those figures….
Most of the figures that I have in those manuscripts are for me more as an example for
the physics, or test the physics, rather than being that there is a detail analysis in those
figures.”
 Conclusion
The evidence strongly suggests that all three figures contain identical data, in
spite of the omitted curves and changes in scale. This substitution was done either
intentionally or recklessly.
The preponderance of evidence indicates that Hendrik Schön committed scientific
misconduct, specifically data falsification, in this case.

III. Data Substitution: Inverter characteristics

“SAMFET” (XII), Fig. 4: “self-assembled

inconsistency in labeling the vertical axis.
 Allegation
Very similar data (inverter
characteristics), were represented as different
materials, circuit topologies, and temperatures
(scales partially changed).
• “SAMFET” Paper (XII), Fig. 4: SAMFET

(II), Fig. 4: “pentacene.”
• “AmbipolarPentacene” Paper (II), Fig. 4: Ambipolar (p- and n-type) pentacene
transistors, in a complementary inverter (see Figure 12)
The rise of the output voltage VOUT at high VIN is highly unusual for inverters, but
is seen in all three cases. The similarity of the “noise” in this region is particularly
E-10 
Appendix E: Elaborated Final List of Allegations
striking. In addition, as discussed in Allegation XIX, the data shown do not appear to be
consistent with the circuit configuration described.
 Response
Hendrik Schön acknowledges substitution of data between the “SAMFET” and
“SingleMolecule” paper, indicating that the data were correct for the SAMFET, and that
there were real data for the “SingleMolecule” case with a gain of 10, not 6.6. He
acknowledged that the latter data were taken at room temperature, although the caption in
the paper said it was taken at 4 K.
Hendrik Schön has characterized some of the data acquisition equipment, and
demonstrated some systematic distortions introduced by that equipment. This was offered
as a possible explanation for the similarities in the “noise.” However, he acknowledged
that the distortions he measured are not large enough to explain those features. The actual
equipment used might conceivably have shown larger distortions, but those instruments
are no longer available.
 Conclusion
The evidence strongly suggests that all three figures contain identical data, except
for modification of some regions. This substitution was done either intentionally or
recklessly.
The preponderance of evidence indicates that Hendrik Schön committed scientific
misconduct, specifically data falsification, in this case.

Appendix E: Elaborated Final List of Allegations
IV. Data Substitution: Ring oscillator time dependence
 Allegation
Figure 13. Time dependence of ring
oscillator output from “FastOrganic”
Paper (XI), Fig. 2: pentacene. The
time axis differs by exactly a factor
12.5. from that for the same material
in Figure 14
Figure 14. Time dependence of ring
oscillator output from
“AmbipolarOrganic” Paper (VIII), Fig.
3: pentacene.
Very similar data (ring oscillator
time dependence) were presented in
different papers, with time scale changed,
but represented as different materials.
• “AmbipolarOrganic” Paper (VIII), Fig.
3: pentacene (see Figure 13).
• “FastOrganic” Paper (XI), Fig 2:
pentacene (see Figure 14).
• “CdS” Paper (VII), Fig. 5: Cadmium
Sulfide (see Figure 15).
Note that in these cases the curves
differ in scale on both time and voltage
axis. In each case, the transient near zero time is very much the same. The waveform is
rather sinusoidal, characteristic for a ring oscillator with a small number of stages.
Figure 15. Time dependence of ring
oscillator output from “CdS” Paper
(VII), Fig. 5: (Cadmium Sulfide).
Vertical axis is changed by exactly a
factor of 2 from Figure 14.
E-12 
Appendix E: Elaborated Final List of Allegations
 Response
Hendrik Schön has acknowledged a procedure for presenting ring oscillator data
collected on an oscilloscope, in which a few points are collected and fit to a sinusoid
(although the general time dependence of a ring oscillator need not be sinusoidal): “…the
ring oscillator measurements were mainly that I read off some numbers from the
oscilloscope and then I use a fit for representing those data…these are not directly
measured data.” He stated that the oscillator was allowed to reach steady-state before
data collection, although all three figures clearly show a transient (identical in each case)
near zero time. (Note that the procedure for capturing such a transient on a standard
oscilloscope would require repeatedly removing and reapplying the supply voltage, a
very tedious procedure.) He stated that he had noted some similarity in the maximum and
minimum voltage levels for his ring oscillators that he thought might reflect some
imperfections in the measurement system, but asserted that the observed oscillation
frequency should be a lower bound on the true result. No primary data for any of the
figures was available.
 Conclusion
Hendrik Schön has
acknowledged procedures that
constitute intentional fabrication of
data: representing fitted data as actual
measurements. The existence and
approximate frequency of the
oscillations would nonetheless be
valid, and he did not acknowledge
copying the measurements. However,
for the “FastOrganic” Paper (XI) and
“CdS” Paper (VII), original plotting
data for the figures was found after
the interview. Figure 16 shows that,
after scaling vertically by 1.5, and horizontally by a different factor, these data are (V)

identical, point by point, including the initial transient. While no electronic data were
found for the “AmbipolarOrganic” Paper (VIII) the similarity is too great to be
accidental. The relabeling of the axes for the different systems constitutes clear,
intentional falsification of data.
The preponderance of evidence indicates that Hendrik Schön committed scientific
misconduct, specifically data fabrication and falsification, in this case.

The “Gate Induced Super” paper
(XXV) shows resistivity versus temperature for different gate-induced carrier densities
(see Figure 17). Original plotting data were extracted from an earlier draft of the paper
containing the same figure. With one exception, the data points in the curves for a density

-2 are identical, differing only by a scale factor of
precisely 3.96 (see Figure 18). The only place where the scaled curves are not identical is
the single point indicating a superconducting transition in the most conductive sample.
Superconductivity is the central issue of the paper. Below 60K, the curves labeled
9.7x1012
cm
-2 and 1.2x1012
cm
-2 are also proportional to the other two as well (see Figure
19), to an accuracy of about 1%.

Appendix E: Elaborated Final List of Allegations
 Response
Schön had no explanation for
these observations. He showed a fifth
curve lying between the others that
showed insulating behavior only at low
temperatures. This data was omitted from
the paper, apparently because it did not fit
with the expectations of the authors.
 Conclusion
It is clear that data were
substituted and scaled between the two
lower curves and spliced together with an
apparent superconducting transition. In
the upper two curves, the same data, below 60 K, were scaled and spliced together with
other data. This substitution was done either intentionally or recklessly.

VI. Data Substitution: Space-charge limited I-V
 Allegation
Figure 20. Current density versus voltage
illustrating space-charge-limited current,
from “Rodlike” Paper (I), Fig. 2.
Very similar current-voltage (“I-V”) data
in a space-charge-limited current measurement
appeared in two papers, represented as different materials:

“HolePentacene” Paper (IX), Fig. 2.
• “Rodlike” Paper (I), Fig. 2, top graph, top curve: “α-6T” (see Figure 20)
• “HolePentacene” Paper (IX), Fig. 2: “pentacene” (see Figure 21)
 Response
Hendrik Schön acknowledges that the “HolePentacene” data were not correct, and
were probably the α-6T data from the “Rodlike” paper (which contained data on both
materials). No primary data were available.
 Conclusion
It has been acknowledged that the data were duplicated. It is conceivable that this
reflects very poor record keeping practices.
While troubling, this instance on its own does not provide compelling evidence of
scientific misconduct.

VII. Data Substitution: Laser emission spectrum
 Allegation
Very similar data
(emission spectra under complex
pulsed bias conditions) were
represented as corresponding to
two different temperatures:
• “Laser” Paper (XIV),
Fig. 2: 5K
• “Laser” Paper (XIV),
Fig. 5: 300K
In particular, the structure
on the emission line, attributed to
Fabry-Perot modes in the laser
cavity, are virtually identical. Also notable is that the peak emission wavelength is
essentially unchanged, while a shift with temperature is expected. (However, the shift is
much smaller for organics than for ordinary inorganic semiconductor lasers).

 Response
Hendrik Schön acknowledged that the room temperature data were in error, and
were actually the 5K data. Some replacement data were offered for the 300K spectra
taken on a different sample. The replacement data were surprisingly similar to the
original plotting data in shape, although shifted and scaled.
Hendrik Schön also volunteered that in another case the measured spectrum was
“extrapolated” using a theoretical, Gaussian line shape.

 Conclusion
Hendrik Schön acknowledges
substitution of data. It is conceivable that
this occurred as a result of very poor
record keeping. He also acknowledged
representing a simple extrapolation as
experimental data. After the interviews,
the data in Figure 23 was extracted from
the original plotting data. It shows that
indeed the highest drive-current spectrum
in the papers was a Gaussian extending
over more than 100 orders of magnitude.
However, rather than being an
“extrapolation” of measured data as
claimed, the very regular structure in the
second derivative (see Figure 23) shows
that all data in the plot were calculated
from the analytical expression. (The fact
that the second derivative hops between
various discrete values, differing by about
1.5%, may result from unknown
procedures such as interpolation.)

Scientific discussion of these
results has included significant attention
to whether the observations reflect true
lasing or only superluminescence. This
controversial issue is a legitimate
scientific question, and we will not
discuss it further here.
The observation of either laser
action or superluminescence was

unprecedented, and has not been reproduced in these material systems. Indeed, no one
except Hendrik Schön ever observed any of the visible light from these structures at all.
The preponderance of evidence indicates that Hendrik Schön committed scientific
misconduct, specifically data fabrication, in this case.

VIII. Data Substitution: Superconducting Tc versus charge
 Allegation
The “Super C60” paper (XIX) shows
data for two separate samples. However, the
transition temperatures for the two sets are largely in exact agreement (see Figure 26).
The original plotting data were extracted from an electronic draft. These showed that the
points at which the transition temperatures were the same for the two “samples” also had
gate voltages that differed by exactly a factor of two for many of the points. The different
hole densities in the original plot arose because the capacitances used to calculate hole
density were not exactly a factor of two different.

unsurprising, the complex physics underlying superconductivity rarely results in such
simple results.

E-22 
Appendix E: Elaborated Final List of Allegations
“FETCaCuO2” Paper (XXI), Fig. 3 shows great similarity, after scaling the axes.
In this case, no clear relationship between the doping axes for the two materials has been
found, but the similarity is still quite high.
 Response
Hendrik Schön describes the procedure for obtaining Tc as follows: Gate voltage
was set, and a temperature sweep was performed. The transition temperature was then
determined by hand from the data plot, using one of several inconsistent procedures; it
was not known which procedure was used for this data. It is to be expected that such a
procedure would yield integer values for the temperature, which then might be the same
between different curves. After this procedure, all the temperatures were multiplied by
1.025, ostensibly to mimic using a slightly higher point on the resistive transition to
define Tc. No primary data for the resistive transitions was offered, and no one except
Hendrik Schön ever saw any of the transitions.
For C60, Bertram Batlogg reports that the first data stopped before reaching the
peak in the transition temperature with doping, and there was active speculation among
the collaborators as to the form that the curve would take thereafter.
Hendrik Schön reported that all of the haloform-intercalated samples were
prepared by him, dissolving and regrowing Christian Kloc’s single crystals of C60. No
structural characterization of the surface layer where superconductivity occurs was
performed. (There is evidence in the literature that the Bromoform-intercalated crystals
are unstable at temperatures above about 90°C, and the Chloroform intercalates above
82°C, which are temperatures that are likely to be reached during deposition of the Al2O3
dielectrics.)
The similarity in shape, after scaling, for the intercalated materials and the
CaCuO2 had been noted in the papers.
 Conclusion
For the two “different” samples of C60, it is unlikely that the procedure described
would result in such great similarities in transition temperatures at closely related
voltages (not hole densities). For the subsequent papers, the high degree of similarity
E-23 
Appendix E: Elaborated Final List of Allegations
suggests that the data may have been fabricated as well. The physics underlying the
transition temperature is very complicated, and it is not to be expected that it would
exhibit such simple scaling. The very similar behavior of electron and hole doping in all
of these materials is also surprising from a physical point of view.
The Tc data from CaCuO2 represent the least convincing evidence of similarity of
the three cases. Allegation XII discusses the much clearer evidence that some of the
resistivity-versus-temperature data for that paper are fabricated.
The high charge densities required for these results cannot be achieved without a
very high breakdown strength of the dielectric. Allegation XVIII discusses the
problematic evidence that these properties have been achieved.
For all of the materials discussed here, the field-induced superconducting
transitions would have been expected to be two-dimensional. Allegation XXIV discusses
the surprising sharpness of the observed transitions, which casts doubt on the
observations for all of the materials in this section.
While extremely troubling, this instance on its own does not provide compelling
evidence of scientific misconduct.

(X), Fig. 4.
 Allegation
Shubnikov-de Haas data were represented as the same, but the longitudinal (Rxx)
and transverse (Rxy) magnetoresistance were shifted relative to one another.
• “FQHE” Paper (IV), Fig. 2 (see Figure 30).
• “NewPhenomena” Paper (X) Fig. 4 (see Figure 31).
The significance of the result is that, in the usual quantum Hall effect, the plateaus
in the Hall resistance Rxy correspond to minima in the longitudinal resistance Rxx, not to
maxima as seen in Figure 31.
 Response
Hendrik Schön acknowledges the shift, which is stated to result from failure to
correct the carrier concentration axis for the threshold voltage. The correction was
applied in the earlier paper “FQHE” but was forgotten when the data were prepared for
the later review paper. Hendrik Schön stated that, in these early measurements, separate
magnetic field sweeps were required for Rxx and Rxy .
E-25 
Appendix E: Elaborated Final List of Allegations
 Conclusion
Hendrik Schön admitted presenting the same data twice, in inconsistent ways.
This error could conceivably reflect sloppiness in data processing. However, after the
interview, the original plotting data for Figure 30 were obtained. In the file, Rxx and Rxy
are listed as separate columns in the same table, with a single density column, as would
be expected if they were measured simultaneously. However, a secondary density, not
measured, but explicitly calculated from the first, was used for Rxy in the figure, while the
uncorrected density was used for Rxx. The correction shifts the data by one half-period
with respect to each other, so that the plateaus in Rxy correspond to minima in Rxx. In the
original plotting data, the plateaus correspond to maxima in Rxx. This is true for both the
“electron” data and the “hole” data. The complexity of the required corrections and their
unsystematic nature provides little confidence in the robustness of the procedures for data
acquisition and presentation.
While troubling, this instance on its own does not provide compelling evidence of
scientific misconduct.

X. Unrealistic Precision: Normal-state resistance of gated C60
 Allegation
Figure 32, from Paper XIX
(“Super C60”) shows an amazing
systematic variation of the resistance
versus temperature as the gate voltage is
varied, which in turn varies the induced
hole concentration in this FET-like
structure. Figure 33 shows the derivative
of original plotting data, dR/dT. The
linearity is truly striking, as is the
reproduction of the wiggles near 50 K.
(It is possible that there could be a
calibration problem with the
thermometer there). Normally, taking a
derivative increases the relative noise, but
these data remain highly linear over most
of the range. The linearity is
demonstrated by taking the second
derivative, as shown in Figure 34.

function. Even the curves for different gate
voltage are the same data, multiplied by a
constant factor.
 Response
Hendrik Schön has acknowledged
that the data in question were generated
analytically (using a functional form
motivated by the observed temperature
dependence), and then spliced together with
the measured transitions and with zeros for
the low-temperature resistance. This was done because it seemed to make a more
compelling presentation. He stated in the interview: “I thought that a smoother curve
would look much better…. In some cases there is less doubts if there is…not that much
noise on the curves.” No primary electronic data were offered, although a data plot was
provided that represented very systematic but realistically noisy, normal-state resistance
data for all of these curves. He maintains that the superconducting transitions were
measured. He stated that the sheet resistances were of the order of several KΩ, so there
should have been significant reductions in the resistance above the transition associated
with fluctuations (see Allegation XXIV). Any information on this phenomenon would
have been destroyed by the splicing procedure. Any smoothing or interpolation
procedures applied to the spliced data would have further polluted the measured points
with the fabricated data.

A similar situation arises for the field-induced superconductivity in C70 reported in

(The data shown come from an Origin file, included in C. Kloc’s files, as supplied by
Lucent.) The smoothness of the second derivative clearly indicates that this data also does
not come from experiment.
 Response
Hendrik Schön initially responded that the observed smoothness resulted from a
smoothing algorithm, for the data in the paper. When presented with the above curve
from unpublished material, he acknowledged that it was generated analytically. He
maintains that the superconductive transitions were measured. No primary data were
available.
E-29

 Conclusion
Hendrik Schön has acknowledged intentionally fabricating data for this plot.
However, the relationship between this curve and the published data is not established.
His volunteered response that the data might be have been created by smoothing real data
appears intentionally misleading, since he did not admit to substituting mathematically
generated data until presented with incontrovertible evidence.
The preponderance of evidence indicates that Hendrik Schön fabricated data in
this case. However, since the relationship between the fabricated data and the published
data has not been clearly established, no finding of scientific misconduct is warranted.

Hendrik Schön acknowledged using analytically generated data for both the

XIII. Unrealistic Precision: Pentacene mobility
 Allegation
The “HolePentacene”
Paper (IX) contains mobility
extracted from the spacecharge-limited current. One of
the exciting things about the
data, taken on high-quality
single crystal samples, was the
observation of very high bandlike mobilities, placing
transport in organics in a whole
new light. Figure 40 the
mobilities as originally
presented, and a comparison
with a theoretical value,
derived at each temperature T
from the µo(T) value in the
same figure and the stated
electric field. Two fitting
parameters are used to match
one of the curves, they are then
used for the whole set. Of the 140 data points in the five curves, 72 of the points are
within 0.1% of the theory. The only larger deviations occur near the crossover to lowtemperature mobility, where the wrong crossover form may have been surmised. The
precise form of the µo plot is not known. According to the paper, it is extrapolated from
the measurement data, so there should be some agreement with one of the five curves.
However, the extraordinary agreement suggests that most of the data curves are generated
from one another.

Hendrik Schön’s initial response claimed that

showed deviations of tens of percent. When
presented with the precise fits during the
interview, Hendrik Schön admitted that
analytical fits to the data were published in the
paper in place of the actual measurements. He
stated that this was a clerical error, in which
the fits were accidentally used instead of
measured data. No primary data were

have been measurements made on different samples at different times.
 Conclusion
Hendrik Schön has acknowledged that calculations were represented as actual
data in this paper. This was done either intentionally or recklessly. Unfortunately, there is
no convincing evidence available that the spectacular mobilities reported in this paper
were ever measured. Other indications of high mobility would be ballistic transport (see
Allegation XIV) and Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (see Allegation IX). There is a
distinguished history in condensed matter physics of higher-quality crystals enabling
improved transport properties, and the Committee does not question the high quality of
the crystals grown by Christian Kloc. However, a host of serious questions surrounds the
indications of spectacularly high mobilities and other transport properties reported by
Hendrik Schön.
The preponderance of evidence indicates that Hendrik Schön committed scientific
misconduct, specifically data fabrication and falsification, in this case.

XIV. Unrealistic Precision: Ballistic transport
 Allegation
Paper XXIII (“Ballistic”)
shows focussing effects in the
magnetoresistance of single crystals
of Pentacene, as illustrated in
Figure 43. This phenomenon has
been observed in more traditional
semiconductor systems, and it
requires specular reflection at the
boundaries of the crystal. It also
requires a collimated beam to
emerge from the contact. In the
earlier demonstrations, specular reflection
and collimation were achieved by using
gates to form smooth “walls” and point
contacts. No such effort was made here.
(The crystals often grow as platelets with a
faceted top and bottom face, but the lateral
edges are not generally so well defined.
The shadow-mask-defined contacts are
certainly not.) Naturally, the transport
mean free path (corresponding to the
momentum relaxation time) must be at
least comparable to the electrode spacing,
several tens of microns.

several percent. Various imperfections in
the sample geometry would presumably
degrade that precision further. Nonetheless,
the data are shown in Figure 44 to agree
very well with the predicted square-root
dependence on magnetic field. By
extracting the original plotting data, the
high-quality agreement shown in Figure 45 is obtained. The peak positions scale with
resonance number and the square root of field with an rms deviation of only 0.4%. This
appears highly unlikely to result from an objective measurement process.

 Response
Hendrik Schön acknowledged a procedure in which the three magnetoresistance
peaks were fit simultaneously (subject to the constraint that they be at integral multiples
of one another). The carrier density (represented as an independent variable) was used as
a fitting parameter to match the peak positions, rather than being calculated from the
known capacitance and threshold. None of this was described in the paper. This
procedure renders the figure completely meaningless, since it is impossible for the points
to do anything other than agree with theory.
Hendrik Schön said that other measurements did not fit as well. No primary data
were available.
 Conclusion
Hendrik Schön acknowledged representing theoretical expectations as measured
data. The paper describes no special attention to the many aspects of the sample geometry

to achieve the spectacular results. The existence of acknowledged fabrication in an
experiment that would be unlikely to succeed so easily is highly troubling.
The preponderance of the evidence indicates that Hendrik Schön committed
scientific misconduct, specifically data falsification, in this case.

XV. Unrealistic Precision: Conductance quantization statistics
 Allegation
Paper XIII
(“SingleMolecule”) describes
SAMFETs in which the active
molecules are diluted with
nonconducting molecules, so that
conduction is controlled by only a
few molecules– sometimes only
one. One piece of evidence for this
is shown in Figure 46: a histogram
of the conductance for various
devices, clustering around integral multiples of the quantum of conductance, 2e2
/h.
Figure 46. Figure 3(B) from “SingleMolecule”
Paper (XIII), showing a histogram of
conductances from diluted SAMFETs,
Several questions arise about this plot. For one, the procedure for determining the
conductance of a device is not clearly specified. Hendrik Schön has acknowledged a
highly unusual procedure– not described in the paper– in which the conductances at
several peaks are added to obtain the value in the plot. The peaks may occur at different
gate and different drain voltages, and are acquired in a measurement with both
parameters varied. The number of samples is also amazing: the plot shows 130 devices
measured at low temperatures. Since the yield of these devices is said to be under 10%,
this implies that at least 1300 devices were characterized to create this plot.
The distribution resembles a Gaussian, but the “tails” are missing. Hendrik Schön
has acknowledged, with no justification, that devices with such values were ignored. If
the distribution results from the independent contributions of spatially separated
molecules, the number of molecules should vary around the average <N>, with an rms
width of roughly <N>1/2
. The observed distribution is narrower (rms width about 3 rather
than 4), which is the opposite ofwhat would be expected if clustering were important. The
widths of the individual peaks also do not increase as expected with the square root of the
number of molecules contributing.
E-39 
Appendix E: Elaborated Final List of Allegations
The most troubling aspect of the data is that, other than the truncated tails, they
match a Gaussian distribution far too well. This is illustrated in Figure 47, where the
reported data are compared with a Gaussian. For this plot, the small variations of
conductance around the quantized value are ignored, and the devices are binned
according to the closest number of conductance quanta. With relatively few samples Ni
for each bin i, one should have seen large variations in the actual observations, typically
Ni
1/2. Indeed, roughly 1/3 of the points would be expected to be outside of the 1σ error
bars shown. For random data, the chance of all of the points being in such agreement with
any functional form is very small.
Quantitatively, this statement can be evaluated by calculating the square of the
ratio of the observed variation to the expected, known as χ2
. For real data this number
should be near 1, but in this case all of the points are closer to the prediction than
expected. For one bin, this could
easily happen by chance, but for
all of them it is quite unlikely.
For the whole distribution, the
average <χ2
>, (which is
normalized to 8-3=5 instead of 8
to reflect the fact that the fit has
three degrees of freedom), is
0.122. The probability of such
high agreement occurring by
chance is estimated at about
1.2%.
The low yield of the
SAMFET devices, and their
possibly unusual behavior, could
allow for unintentional bias in
selecting samples to skew the results. However, such bias cannot explain these
observations, because the quality of the overall distribution is only apparent after all

devices have been accepted or rejected. The only explanation is that points are included
or discarded solely to improve the agreement with the distribution.
 Response
These observations were noted by Sources M and D in October 2001, and
discussed with Hendrik Schön and others at Bell Labs beginning that same month. In
mid-December 2001, Hendrik Schön responded in detail, including numerical data for
Figure 46, together with an explanation: the original figure had been constructed with a
bar width on the histogram several times wider than the spacing of the bins, which
obscured some of the points. This bizarre procedure seemed to resolve the problem: the
above analysis applied to the new data yielded a <χ2
> of about 0.9, well within reason.
However, it was discovered in May 2002 that the original plotting data were still
embedded in an original electronic draft. These original plotting data show the disturbing
characteristics described previously, and illustrated in Figure 46.
Prior to the interview, Hendrik Schön was made aware that the original plotting
data was available. In the interview, he presented a new explanation: by accident, some
of the original data (every other point) had been omitted from the plot in the paper.
However, systematically removing every other point in the distribution without prejudice
as to the overall form should still have produced data constrained by Poisson statistics, so
even this mistake would not resolve the fundamental problem. Hendrik Schön still had no
explanation for the original observation.
No body of primary data for the current, as a function of gate and drain voltage,
was available.
 Conclusion
The data indicating conductance quantization did not arise from an objective
measurement process. At a minimum, the assignment of conductance values was colored
by the expected shape of the final distribution. Such a biased process cannot provide
convincing evidence for quantization. The response to this concern appears to be
deliberately deceptive, suggesting that this misrepresentation was intentional.
The preponderance of evidence indicates that Hendrik Schön committed scientific
misconduct, specifically data fabrication, in this case.

XVI. Unrealistic Precision: SAMFET Dilution series
 Allegation
The inset of Fig. 1(B) of the
“SingleMolecule” paper (XIII) shows perfect
scaling of the drain current down a dilution
ratio of 5000. In this experiment, the number
of electrically active molecules expected in
the active area of the SAMFET is reduced by
dilution with electrically inactive alkanethiol
molecules. At this dilution, it is claimed that
one would expect on average about one
molecule in the device, but Poisson statistics
would predict sometimes 0, sometimes 2
(see Figure 48). Note that, if two molecules
were present, as would be expected to
happen quite frequently from Poisson
statistics, the result would be noticeably off the line (zero molecules would not conduct,
and might be eliminated as defective). No description of the sample selection procedure
or the variability of these highly diluted samples is given in the paper.

Figure 49 shows the scaled conductance relative
to the expected number of molecules, computed
as the drain current times the dilution ratio. The
maximum deviation from the highest to lowest
value is 25%, and the 1000 and 5000x diluted
samples show a drain current that scales with
nominal dilution to an amazing 0.7%.
 Response
In interviews and data provided,
Hendrik Schön acknowledged that the drive
currents for the SAMFETs varied by a factor of
ten. He acknowledged that in constructing this
plot he selected devices that matched his theoretical expectations. In the interview, he
stated “I did not correctly average for all the devices that I had, did not include an error
bar. I put in current numbers that would reasonably agree with this line…. I chose data
that would agree with it….I thought this nice agreement would be a better way to show
it.”

 Conclusion
Selective use of data to support a point is a judgement call, and poor judgement
does not inherently constitute misconduct. However, in this case the selection process is
so prejudiced as to constitute falsification, even if, as Hendrik Schön claims, the “trend”
is the same.
Moreover, if the devices intrinsically vary by a factor of ten, one would have
needed about eighteen devices to select from at each dilution (ninety total), to have a
reasonable chance of finding this degree of agreement1
. It is likely that more than simple
selection of unbiased results was involved.
The preponderance of evidence indicates that Hendrik Schön committed scientific
misconduct, specifically data falsification, in this case.

would be required.

XVII. Unrealistic Precision: SAMFET width series
 Allegation
The ability of the
SAMFETs to turn off with gate
voltage is totally in contradiction
to the electrostatics of the stated
structure, with a 30nm oxide over
a 2nm channel (see Allegation
XX). One explanation would be
that the actual device measured
was a parasitic MOSFET, for
example at the trench edge, which
might have a long channel more
consistent with the electrical
behavior. However, this parasitic
device would be formed in the
regions of the trench that are not
intentionally part of the device, and
so should not scale with the intended
width of the nominal transistor.
Showing that the observed current
scales with the width of the area
where the claimed transistor action
was happening is an essential crosscheck that the device is where it was
intended.

the statement. However, in January of 2002 the data of Figure 50 were presented to a Bell
Labs audience. The plot shows the scaling of the drain current with channel width, as
stated. The scaling is extraordinarily good. Figure 51 shows the same data, replotted
normalized to width. The deviation between highest and lowest normalized current
densities is 4%. This type of systematic behavior is much better than is typically observed
even in Si manufacturing, let alone in an ad hoc research process. For example, suppose
there were a process bias ∆W resulting from imperfections in mask generation,
lithography, trench etching, evaporation, or metal etching of 1000Å (0.1 µm) per side.
(This would require very precise process control on all of those steps or extraordinary
luck for large numbers to add to something small. Hendrik Schön acknowledged that the
lithography in Konstanz had a 10-15 µm resolution.) One would then expect a deviation
of 2 ∆W/W in the apparent current density, which would be 40% for the 0.5µm width, ten
times the reported variation.
Figure 52 (from the same PowerPoint presentation) represents the linear
dependence on gate width and the independence of the current on the overlapping part of
the structure, and is similarly astounding in its precision.
Hendrik Schön acknowledged
the mask as having only two trench
widths available. Some variation in
device widths could be obtained by
varying the deposition angle, but
avoiding unintended parasitics places
complex constraints on this process,
and the resulting device sizes would
need to be measured individually by,
for example, scanning electron
microscopy. Such measurements could
not give devices with such welldefined round numbers for widths and
lengths (and thus area) as illustrated in

 Response
Hendrik Schön acknowledged that data had been selected to illustrate the intended
trend. No primary data on either the device characteristics or the device width and length
characterization were offered.
 Conclusion
Hendrik Schön has acknowledged selecting data to match expectations. As in
Allegation XVI, such selection would have required sifting through a huge number of
devices– thousands in this case— to obtain the precise results for more than thirty
geometries in Figure 52. Moreover, he has acknowledged an intrinsic variability of the
fabrication process that results in widths varying by a factor of two. Two widths were
included on the mask; others could be obtained by carefully varying deposition angles in
separate runs. Figure 51 and Figure 52 both imply widths that are precise round numbers,
in microns. All of this evidence suggests that the data are not just selected, but fabricated.
The preponderance of evidence indicates that Hendrik Schön fabricated data in
this case. However, since no relationship between the fabricated data and any published
data has been established, no finding of scientific misconduct is warranted. Nonetheless,
since these data were invoked as evidence that the assumed mechanism for SAMFET
operation was correct, that mechanism must be regarded as highly suspect.

XVIII. Unrealistic Precision: Characterization of sputtering
process
 Allegation
Many questions have been raised about why the breakdown strength of Hendrik
Schön’s sputtered Al2O3 was so much greater than others have been able to achieve.
Values up to 70-80 MV/cm (at low temperatures) are implicit in some of the fieldinduced superconductivity data; for the “Sputtering” Paper a mean of 23 MV/cm was
indicated at room temperature. As reported to the Committee, various recent attempts to
reproduce Hendrik Schön’s results have so far been limited at 12 – 15 MV/cm, including
work at the University of Konstanz using the same sputtering system used by Hendrik
Schön in most of the work in question. In the “Sputtering” Paper Hendrik Schön
provides evidence that the mean breakdown strength increases from 23 MV/cm at room
temperature to 32 MV/cm at 220 K.
Reportedly, Hendrik Schön was strongly encouraged by Bertram Batlogg, his
management, and external scientists to document the processing conditions and
optimization of his Al2O3 gate insulators, to enable the reproduction of these results. The
result is the unpublished “Sputtering” Paper (XXIV), included in the materials provided
to the Committee by Bell Labs. This document was distributed in preprint form, and also
submitted for publication. It has received wide circulation in the community, and for this
reason it was judged appropriate for consideration by the Committee along with
published papers. This document shows a level of statistical precision that is virtually
unheard of in processing experiments, and in any event inconsistent with the reported size
of the data set.

Figure 2 of the “Sputtering”
Paper (XXIV) is a histogram of
breakdown fields for a particular set
of processing conditions within the
“sweet spot” claimed by Hendrik
Schön (see below). The line shows
a best-fit Gaussian model. This
Gaussian fit yields a mean
breakdown field of 23.8 MV/cm
and a standard deviation of 6.04
MV/cm. The data set includes over
600 samples, reportedly deposited and measured episodically over several years.

Figure 2 of “Sputtering” Paper (XXIV) (original

There are several problems with these data. First, a Gaussian distribution is not
expected. More typical breakdown data show many points clustered at the true, intrinsic
breakdown and a tail at lower breakdown fields, described by a Weibull distribution.
Nonetheless, the agreement with the Gaussian distribution is excellent. Indeed, the χ2 for
these data is about 0.41; a simple estimate of the probability of such good agreement
arising from chance for the reported sample size of 600 is about 0.02%.
According to the histogram, one can get the very highest fields implied by the
experiments only by operating at the extreme high end of the breakdown distribution,
accepting the resultantly low yield. If the distribution were tighter, or skewed to low
breakdowns, or there were no increase at low temperatures, these high breakdown fields
would not be available. Hendrik Schön stated that if he did not observe superconductivity
after a few tries, he would move on to something else.

Figure 54 shows a
contour plot of the breakdown
field as a function of two
process variables: deposition
rate and pressure. For those
familiar with process studies
and contour plots, it is
extraordinary to see such a
plot. Such smooth contours are
not possible unless the “z axis”
data are very precisely
specified, and process studies
are usually difficult to
reproduce with precision,
especially on typical research
equipment. (In this case, Hendrik
Schön claims that this was “not a
systematic study,” but simply a
compilation of data taken over a
period of several years; this makes
the extraordinary reproducibility
even more surprising.) One
purpose of this plot is to illustrate
the small “sweet spot” of the
deposition near 0.02 nm/s
deposition rate and 5 mbar

This plot contains a dense array of points at twelve deposition rates and twelve
pressures, including a large section of parameter space where the films are not very good.
Consequently, there are 144 different deposition conditions specified. In each case, the
signal-to-noise of the breakdown is very high. As illustrated in the Figure 55 (a slice of
E-50 
Appendix E: Elaborated Final List of Allegations
the above contour plot), the scatter appears to be less than 1MV/cm. Thus this figure
requires a total of 36x144=5,184 breakdown measurements to be made. (To obtain the
mean breakdown field to a precision of 1MV/cm requires roughly 36 measurements
(6MV/cm / 1MV/cm)
2
, because of the 6 MV/cm standard deviation of the breakdown
field).
The paper says that 150 samples were made at each of 36 conditions, also more
than 5000 measurements. Most of them contribute little to the information about the
process optimum. The phenomenal effort required to create this data, together with the
fact that deposition systems do not as a rule behave this reproducibly, is the reason most
process studies have just a few points.
For completeness, some
caveats in the paper include the
possibility that the breakdown
criteria used here are more
tolerant than in traditional
breakdown studies, and the
possibility of some history effect
in the chamber.
Finally, this preprint also
contains an illustration of fieldinduced superconductivity
involving sweeping the gate
voltage up and then down (see
Figure 56). Detailed examination (from the original plotting data in the electronic draft)
shows that the sweep up and down are the same data to six significant figures, precisely
reflected around the maximum field.

 Response
Hendrik Schön supplied voluminous documentation describing the results of the
breakdown studies. He was not able to explain the statistical anomalies. The description
of some of the aspects of the breakdown measurement have changed during revision. For
E-51 
Appendix E: Elaborated Final List of Allegations
example, it was noted by Bertram Batlogg (in email to Hendrik Schön) that the
breakdown measurements in Figure 54 would have taken 2.4 years, using the sweep rates
stated in an early version of the preprint. The sweep rate in the paper was subsequently
modified from 0.001 V/s to 1 V/s. According to Hendrik Schön and the documentation
provided, the actual process matrix was 6x6, and the 12x12 points in the contour plot
were created by smoothing and interpolation. No justification was offered for this
information-destroying procedure, except “to give a nicer contour plot.” Surprisingly, this
smoothing and interpolation procedure did not reduce the excellent breakdown field at
the “sweet spot” (compare the blue squares in Figure 55 to the other symbols).
Included in the documentation Hendrik Schön provided to the Committee was a
tabulation of the breakdown fields of all 150 samples for each of the 36 deposition
conditions represented in the contour plot. Not one of the 5400 measurements indicated a
breakdown field less than 3.7 MV/cm.
When presented with the details of symmetry of the field sweep demonstration of
superconductivity, Hendrik Schön acknowledged that the data had been artificially
symmetrized.
 Conclusion
The data presented in this preprint are so statistically improbable that it seems
impossible that they represent real data, free of some selection process or some other
misrepresentation.
The wide distribution of this preprint among scientists in this field is considered
by the Committee to be tantamount to publication. The preponderance of evidence
indicates that Hendrik Schön committed scientific misconduct, specifically data
fabrication, in this case.

XIX. Contradictory Physics: Unipolar inverter characteristics
 Allegation
The “SAMFET” and
“SingleMolecule” Papers (XII and
XIII) report measurements of
inverters wired in a “unipolar”
configuration, with the gate of the
pull-up, “load” transistor tied to the
upper supply voltage (see the inset
of Figure 11). This circuit topology
behaves very differently than a
“complementary” inverter that uses
both p- and n-channel transistors. In
particular, the two configurations
differ markedly in their dependence on the ratio m of the drive current of the pull-down to
that of the pull-up transistor. These differences are described in conjunction with Figure
57.

unipolar
The maximum slope of the transfer characteristic, the gain, must be greater than
one if inverters are to drive one another without degrading the logic levels. For a
complementary inverter, the gain is largest when the transistors are matched, m = 1. For a
unipolar inverter, the gain can be large only if the “load” transistor (with gate tied to the
supply) is much weaker than the “drive” transistor; the gain is roughly the square root of
m. Thus the reported gain of 6-10 would require m of 36-100.
For the unipolar inverter, the output voltage is only gradually pulled down,
eventually reaching a minimum value of Vsupply/2(1+m). Thus the observed outputs of .05
V for a 2 V supply suggest m = 20. For a complementary inverter, the pull-up (pulldown) turns off as the input voltage approaches within its threshold voltage of the lower
(upper) supply, so the output can easily go “rail-to-rail,” reaching very close to zero
(supply voltage). For the unipolar inverter, the maximum output voltage VHI is lower
E-53 
Appendix E: Elaborated Final List of Allegations
than the supply voltage by the threshold voltage of the load transistor. The observed
characteristics get very close to the respective rails, as in a complementary inverter.
The unipolar inverter typically shows a “kink” when the load transistor turns on,
The rounded characteristic observed is much more similar to a complementary inverter
characteristic.
The methodology for selecting transistors for the inverters and ring oscillators, in
particular the drive current ratio, was not described in the paper. Hendrik Schön indicated
in private email: “…in the inverter circuits I try to match the drive and load transistor to
get a good switching behavior. Since I wire them externally the FET characteristics of the
individual device is known before.”
It is also surprising that, if the transistors used in the inverter can be operated at
2V, they were characterized only at much lower voltage in the triode data.
 Response
Hendrik Schön expressed doubt as to whether the “kink” in the inverter
characteristic is a robust feature of a unipolar circuit. He also presented sketches
indicating that a kink was sometimes observed (but not published).
Hendrik Schön described the very unusual rise of the output voltage at high input
voltages, seen in all of the transfer characteristics, as possibly being an instrumental
artifact.
In the interview, Hendrik Schön recanted the email indicating matched currents
were used. Instead, he described a highly unsystematic and time-consuming procedure
for choosing the transistors to obtain a good inverter characteristic. Hendrik Schön raised
the possibility that unspecified changes induced in the transistors during the measurement
process might have altered the inverter characteristics. In no case were the primary triode
characteristics for the transistors comprising the inverters retained.
 Conclusion
The evidence indicates that the unipolar inverter data were not taken as described,
since the actual data are consistent with a complementary circuit. In Allegation III, these
unipolar inverters are both alleged to be identical to earlier data on a true complementary

inverter, which would explain their properties. The presentation of these data in this
context therefore constitutes falsification, either intentional or reckless.
The preponderance of evidence indicates that Hendrik Schön committed scientific
misconduct, specifically data falsification, in this case. The specific evidence supporting
this conclusion is that discussed in connection with Allegation III.

Appendix E: Elaborated Final List of Allegations
XX. Contradictory Physics: SAMFET subthreshold swing
 Allegation
Papers XII (“SAMFET”), XIII (“SingleMolecule”) and XVI (“NanoSAMFET”)
reported transistor characteristics for molecular devices that were superior to the best
commercial Field Effect Transistors (FET's). For example, there is well-known constraint
that a gate voltage change of at least (kT/e) ln 10 (which is around 60 mV) is required to
turn off the current by a factor of ten. This constraint should apply to any device using the
FET principle. The SAMFET's reported in these papers took far less gate voltage to turn
off than this ideal minimum. What made these observations even more surprising was the
fact that the devices as described had a very poor aspect ratio: the oxide thickness (~30
nm) was over ten times the reported channel length. Standard FET's usually have these
dimensions reversed: the channel length is ten times the oxide thickness. This is
necessary so that the gate, rather than the drain, controls the electrostatic potential.
Another surprising observation was the reported transconductance ~ 10 mS/µm ~
10,000 mS/mm which is in excess of the values reported for state-of-the-art FET's (~
1,000 mS/mm), achieved after thousands of man-years of development.
The background leakage of the SAMFETs is several orders of magnitude lower
than would have been expected, based on the stated geometry and scanning probe
measurements of leakage current on similar systems.
 Response
Hendrik Schön acknowledged the surprising nature of these results, but maintains
that a new physical mechanism may be at work.
 Conclusion
These observations are clearly inconsistent with known physical mechanisms for
MOSFET operation. It is possible that new, unspecified mechanisms are important.
However, since much of the published data associated with this work were substituted
from other sources or fabricated (see Allegations I, III, XIX, XV, XVI) the committee
E-56 
Appendix E: Elaborated Final List of Allegations
has serious doubts about the integrity of the data and finds it difficult to take it at face
value.
The preponderance of the evidence indicates that Hendrik Schön committed
scientific misconduct, specifically data falsification, in this case. The specific evidence
supporting this conclusion is that discussed in connection with Allegations I and XVII.
The data presented by Zhenan Bao, on structures that she fabricated (in Fig. 3 of
paper XVI (“NanoSAMFET”), do not exhibit the inexplicably high gate coupling
discussed here. That subset of the paper therefore does not contradict prevailing scientific
understanding.

XXI. Contradictory Physics: Hysteretic planar Josephson weak
links
 Allegation
Fig. 1 in “TunableWeakLinks”
Paper (XVII) shows a standard planar
SNS weak-link geometry (see Figure 58).
Devices with this geometry have a low
capacitance between the superconducting
"banks," and their I-V characteristics
should be non-hysteretic, exhibiting a
very steep rise in current, followed by a
leveling-out, eventually merging into an
asymptotic normal resistance
characteristic. Instead, Fig. 2 of the paper
shows a hysteretic characteristic that looks like a textbook representation of a
conventional tunnel junction of sandwich geometry, with its high, hysteresis-inducing
capacitance (see Figure 59 below). However, the nominal separation between
superconducting banks is far too large (>50nm) for any tunnel junction to form having
currents on the order of microamperes. This inconsistency was pointed out by a referee,
but was not addressed in the paper.
Figure 58. Fig. 2 from
“TunableWeakLinks” Paper (XVII),
showing hysteretic I-V characteristic for a
planar weak link.
 Response
Hendrik Schön suggested that the actual junctions were formed at geometrical
irregularities that arose due to the use of shadow masks during deposition, for example
where the metal pads accidentally formed unusually narrow gaps. He showed a sketch of
such a structure to represent what he had seen in a scanning electron microscope.
However, he could provide no scanning electron micrographs or optical photographs of
any of the related structures. While such accidental geometries could conceivably change
the microscopic parameters, no detailed explanation of the hysteretic junctions was given.
E-58 
Appendix E: Elaborated Final List of Allegations
Hendrik Schön also acknowledged that some of the junctions that he studied
looked non-hysteretic, but he did not explain why that fact was not included in the
original paper. Indeed, the Committee learned that a referee for this paper asked very
pointed questions about this issue, but apparently he or she was not informed that both
types of junction existed.
 Conclusion
The assertion that non-hysteretic I-V characteristics had, in fact, been seen,
combined with the explicit raising of this issue by a referee, makes it extremely puzzling
why the authors did not use (or even mention) those characteristics in their paper. It
appears evident that the authors had only a very rudimentary understanding of
superconducting weak links and of the differences between their properties and those of
the more-widely studied tunnel junctions. The committee can only speculate that, as a
result, the authors expected tunnel-like characteristics, and selected for presentation those
data that met this expectation.
This still does not explain how the tunnel-like characteristics actually arose. The
most that can be said is that they are not consequences of the simple geometrical model
of Fig. 1, if the latter is taken at face value, but must be due to extraneous effects.
While extremely troubling, this instance on its own does not provide compelling
evidence of scientific misconduct.

XXII. Contradictory Physics: Low sub-gap conductance
 Allegation
Figure 59 shows a “typical” I-V
characteristic of the planar junctions
reported in “PlasticSquid” Paper (XVIII).
This I-V curve shows a hysteretic tunneljunction-like characteristic that appears to
be inconsistent with the very low
capacitance expected in such a planar
geometry and with the nominal length of
the barrier (50nm), which is much too
long to achieve ideal tunneling. A weaklink-type I-V would seem more likely for
such long junctions (see the related
discussion for Allegation XXI). Also,
the tunneling-like I-V curve shows a very
low sub-gap conductance. Such low
conductance would only be expected at very low temperatures, well below those in which
the data were taken, assuming a transition temperature as seen in other papers on
polythiophene. Finally, peaks in the second derivative of the I-V characteristic are
reported and interpreted as so-called “phonon peaks”, which suggest the electron-phonon
interaction as the mechanism for the superconductivity in polythiophene. The problem is
that this mechanism leads to dips, not peaks, in the second derivative. These various
problems have caused some to doubt the validity of the data. Current (arb. units)

Paper (XVIII) showing surprising,

junction.
 Response
In his response to allegations regarding tunable Josephson Junctions (Allegation
XX), Hendrik Schön described how he used a shadow mask to define the barrier length in
these planar junctions and claimed that the actual length of the junctions could be much
less than the nominal value. He described how he selected junctions for test based on
E-60 
Appendix E: Elaborated Final List of Allegations
their finite (as opposed to zero) conductance. Therefore, the actual length of the barriers
is not known. He also acknowledged that weak-link-like characteristics were sometimes
seen. No explanation was offered for the low sub-gap conductance, which is the principle
issue here. Schön acknowledged that the inversion of the peaks resulted from negative
“arbitrary units.”
 Conclusion
Given that the exact length of the barrier in these junctions is not known, but
arguably much less than 50nm, it is hard to make a judgment. It seems very unlikely that
true tunnel junctions could be achieved this way, but these are very unusual material
systems whose barrier properties are not known independently. The low sub-gap
conductance is clearly problematic. The problem with the second derivative of the I-V
curve could be a simple plotting error.
While troubling, this instance on its own does not provide compelling evidence of
scientific misconduct.

XXIII. Contradictory Physics: Squid results
 Allegation
In the same “PlasticSquid”
Paper (XVIII) discussed in the
allegation above, magnetic
diffraction data for the critical
current of a SQUID device were
also presented. The data are
shown in Figure 60. By the usual
convention, one assumes that the
open circles are measured data
and the solid line is either a
theoretical calculation or some fit
to the data, although the paper makes no statement about the meaning of the different
symbols. Under the assumption that the solid line is a theoretical calculation, some
critics have argued that the agreement is well beyond what is normally seen, causing
them to question the data. Another problem is that the magnetic periodicity seen in the
data are not compatible with the measured 10um2 area of the device.

Current ( ) Figure 60. Plot of modulation of critical current by

 Response
In response to questioning, Hendrik Schön stated that he was not certain whether
the open symbols in the figure represent real data or not. No original (raw) data files
exist with which to check this point. He also explained that the solid curve is not a
calculation based on theory, but rather a simple mathematical function (the absolute value
of the sine function, offset from zero). He stood by the value of the area determined by
the magnetic periodicity.
 Conclusion
Clearly, the data in the figure have no verifiable basis. The meaning of the solid
line is confusing, at best, and should have been explained in the paper. The disagreement
E-62 
Appendix E: Elaborated Final List of Allegations
between the measured area and that inferred from the data does not necessarily represent
a serious discrepancy, given the planar nature of this SQUID and uncertainties of the
strong field perturbations due to demagnetization effects in this geometry.
It is very disturbing that there is ambiguity in the meaning of the open symbols in
Figure 4 of the paper, given that the solid line is an analytical construct. This suggests an
irresponsible attitude toward data.
While troubling, this instance on its own does not provide compelling evidence
of scientific misconduct.
E-63 
Appendix E: Elaborated Final List of Allegations
XXIV. Contradictory Physics: Sharp 2-D superconducting
transitions
 Allegation
The field-effect doping induced superconductivity should almost certainly be twodimensional. 2-D superconductivity is subject to well-established fluctuation phenomena
that cause rounding (i.e. broadening) of the superconducting transition, both above and
below the mean-field BCS transition.
Above the mean-field transition, fluctuations toward the superconducting state
enhance the conductivity, causing lower resistivity than the extrapolated normal state
resistivity. The relative importance of this effect becomes significant as the normal-state
sheet resistance approaches the inverse of quantum of conductance h/4e2
, or about 6.5
KΩ. As a rule, Hendrik Schön plotted resistances in “arbitrary units,” making it
impossible to evaluate whether this fundamental effect should be evident. However, in
the plots of the superconducting transition (see Figure 61, below), the normal state
resistivity data show no deviation from parabolic behavior right down to the transition.
Below the mean-field superconducting transition, the well-known KosterlitzThouless (KT) vortex-antivortex unbinding transition expected in 2D superconductors
produces a nonzero resistance above the KT transition temperature. For high sheetresistance superconductors, this leads to a significant broadening of the transition.
Unfortunately, in many plots, such as Figure 32, the transitions are plotted on scale that
suppresses information about the resistive tail, other than that it is extraordinarily small
for films with Tc of tens of Kelvin.
 Response
No detailed physical explanation for the sharpness of the transition was offered by
any coauthor. Bertram Batlogg recalled that he tried very hard to get Hendrik Schön to
include an absolute sheet resistance in the published data, although in the end that was
not generally done. During the interviews, Hendrik Schön acknowledged typical sheet
resistances of 1-10 KΩ per square, so that fluctuation effects should have been evident.
E-64 
Appendix E: Elaborated Final List of Allegations
 Conclusion
The Committee finds the
reported sharpness of the
superconducting transitions for
these films to be contradictory to
prevailing physics and the stated
sample structure.
It is highly relevant that
the resistance versus temperature
curves discussed here are
precisely the curves for which
Hendrik Schön has admitted
splicing together the actual
transition with an analytic form
above the transition and zeros
below the transition (see Allegation X, for example). If there had been measured data
exhibiting fluctuation resistance and resistive tails, those procedures would have
obliterated them. Moreover, a normal state resistance spliced in the fluctuation regime
would not have agreed with the actual resistivity at higher temperatures. As shown in
Figure 61 for one of the curves, very little data remains after these procedures.

original 117 remain after acknowledged spliced points

obscured by this procedure.
The absence of fluctuation effects in the resistive transitions of C60 appears to be
inconsistent with prevailing scientific understanding, and thus would, if true, demand
radical new explanations. On the other hand, as determined in Allegation X, the data in
question here are now known not to be real. Hence, the physical question posed cannot
be adjudicated. No conclusion is possible and any judgment on the existence or not of
fluctuations in any superconducting transition in C60 is deferred to the appropriate
scientific community.
The preponderance of the evidence suggests that Hendrik Schön committed
scientific misconduct in this case. The specific evidence supporting this conclusion is that
discussed in connection with Allegation X.

Comments on the Allegations/Observation Document
(Draft 06/19/02)
This document is intended as a thorough, straightforward compilation of the allegations
and observations received by the Investigation Committee to date bearing on possible
scientific misconduct by the authors indicated. It is based on the report transmitted to
the Committee by Lucent Technologies of their initial inquiry into the allegations, written
communications sent directly to the Committee and verbal communications taken to be
credible by the Committee.
It contains both entries that suggest directly scientific misconduct and entries that note
scientific issues that can reasonably be taken to raise questions as to the validity of the
data.
The document does not reflect any rank ordering or any other judgment by the
Committee regarding the allegations.

Appendix H: Responses of Authors to this Report
I. Response of Hendrik Schön
Although I disagree with several of the findings and conclusions in the report of
the investigation committee on the possibility of scientific misconduct in the work of
Hendrik Schön and coauthors, I have to admit that I made various mistakes in my
scientific work, which I deeply regret. Some of these mistakes might have been related
to difficult circumstances and others I did not realize in time. Nevertheless, it was my
responsibility and there are no excuses for these mistakes and would like to apologize
honestly for these mistakes to the coauthors and the scientific community.
However, I would like to state that all the scientific publications that I prepared
were based on experimental observations. I have observed experimentally the various
physical effects reported in these publications, such as the Quantum Hall effect,
superconductivity in various materials, lasing, or gate-modulation in self-assembled
monolayers, and I am convinced that they are real, although I could not prove this to the
investigation committee. Furthermore, I believe that these results will be reproduced in
the future and, if possible for me, I am willing to work hard on this task, since
reproduction will be the only prove of these scientific effects.
Based on experimental observations I tried to communicate the science that
described the experimental findings and that I was convinced of. Although I have made
mistakes, I never wanted to mislead anybody or to misuse anybody’s trust. I realize that
there is a lack of credibility in light of these mistakes, nevertheless, I truly believe that the
reported scientific effects are real, exciting, and worth working for.

II. Response of Bertram Batlogg
After having read the draft report, and having heard over the phone of some
changes, I would like to submit respectfully a comment.
On the topic of “responsibility of co-authors,” I am pleased to find a very high
level of agreement between the committee’s views, as expressed in the report, and my
views as expressed in the telephone interview and the follow-up written Comment. In
particular I acknowledge that this topic entails questions that are difficult to answer
because of a lack of broadly based discussions and consensus in the scientific
community.
In the main text, a sentence reads “A senior co-author who has paid close
attention … and who has asked searching questions is in a much better position to
support his colleague in defending his work”. This sentence, while correct in the abstract,
may be taken in this specific case and context to imply that such searching questioning
did not take place. Such an impression would be substantially incorrect and counter to the
reality as communicated to the Committee. Indeed, questions for additional data and for
experimental details have been an important part of the “quality and validity control”
exercised by myself, and also by experts at Bell Labs who have not been collaborators.
These experts have been explicitly involved in scrutinizing papers for technical
correctness. To probing questions I received, and so did those other critical colleagues,
answers that appeared at that time reasonable and satisfactory and that would not indicate
any reason to doubt the validity of the work. Thus I would have preferred a slightly
modified sentence conveys the fact that in the present case such probing questions have
indeed been regularly posed by many scientists, particularly also by myself, and that they
were met with satisfactory answers.
Once more, I thank the Members of the Committee for their work that has led to
this report.
